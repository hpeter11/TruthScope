The 2024–25 UEFA Champions League is the 70th season of Europe's premier club football tournament organised by UEFA, and the 33rd season since it was rebranded from the European Champion Clubs' Cup to the UEFA Champions League. This is the first season under a new format, with 36 participating teams that played eight games each against different opponents in a league phase, all the teams being ranked in a joint group. This will increase the total number of matches played in the competition from 125 to 189 (excluding qualifying rounds).
The final will be played on 31 May 2025 at Allianz Arena in Munich, Germany. The winners of the 2024–25 UEFA Champions League will automatically qualify for the 2025–26 UEFA Champions League league phase, the 2025 FIFA Intercontinental Cup finals, the 2029 FIFA Club World Cup group stage, and earn the right to play against the winners of the 2024–25 UEFA Europa League in the 2025 UEFA Super Cup.
Real Madrid are the defending champions, having won their record-extending 15th title the previous season.


== Association team allocation ==
A total of 81 teams from 53 of the 55 UEFA member associations are participating in the 2024–25 UEFA Champions League (the exceptions being Liechtenstein, which did not organise a domestic league, and Russia, which was suspended). The association ranking based on the UEFA association coefficients was used to determine the number of participating teams for each association:

Associations 1–5 each have four teams.
Association 6 has three teams.
Associations 7–15 each have two teams.
Associations 16–55 (except Liechtenstein and Russia) each have one team.
The winners of the 2023–24 UEFA Champions League and 2023–24 UEFA Europa League were each given an additional entry if they did not qualify for the 2024–25 UEFA Champions League through their domestic league.
The two associations who obtained the most coefficient points in the 2023–24 season each had one European Performance Spot into the league phase. The winners of the UEFA Champions League and Europa League could not fill the European Performance Spots.


=== Association ranking ===
For the 2024–25 UEFA Champions League, the associations were allocated places according to their 2023 UEFA association coefficients, which took into account their performance in European competitions from 2018–19 to 2022–23. The table reflects Russia's ongoing suspension from UEFA.
Apart from the allocation based on the association coefficients, associations could have additional teams participating in the Champions League, as noted below:

(EPS) – European Performance Spot, the additional berths for associations who finished in the top two of the 2023–24 association coefficients
(TH) – Additional berth for UEFA Champions League title holders
(EL) – Additional berth for UEFA Europa League title holders


=== Distribution ===

The information here reflects the suspension of Russia in European football, and so the following changes to the default access list were made:

The champions of associations 23 (Sweden) and 24 (Poland) entered the second qualifying round instead of the first qualifying round (Champions Path).
As the Champions League title holders (Real Madrid) qualified via their domestic league's standard berth allocation, the following changes to the default access list were made:

Shakhtar Donetsk as the club with the highest club coefficient that would otherwise have entered the Champions Path of the qualifying phase or play-off round, entered the league phase instead of the Champions Path play-off round.
Dinamo Zagreb, as the club with the highest club coefficient that would otherwise have entered the Champions Path second qualifying round, entered the Champions Path play-off round.
Ferencváros and Qarabağ, as the two clubs with the highest club coefficient that would otherwise have entered the Champions Path first qualifying round, entered the Champions Path second qualifying round.
As the Europa League title holders (Atalanta) qualified via their domestic league's standard berth allocation, the following changes to the default access list were made:

Benfica, as the club with the highest club coefficient that would otherwise have entered the League Path third qualifying round, entered the league phase instead of the League Path third qualifying round.
Slavia Prague and Red Bull Salzburg, as the two clubs with the highest club coefficient that would otherwise have entered the League Path second qualifying round, entered the third qualifying round.


=== Teams ===
The labels in the parentheses show how each team qualified for the place of its starting round:

TH: Champions League title holders
EL: Europa League title holders
1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, etc.: League positions of the previous season
EPS: The European Performance Spots given to clubs from the two associations with the highest coefficient points in 2023–24
The second qualifying round, third qualifying round and play-off round were divided into Champions Path (CH) and League Path (LP).


== Round and draw dates ==

== League phase ==

The league phase draw for the 2024–25 UEFA Champions League took place at the Grimaldi Forum in Monaco on 29 August 2024, 18:00 CEST. The 36 teams were divided into four pots of nine teams each based on their UEFA club coefficient, except for the Champions League title holders, who were automatically placed as the top seed in pot 1.
The 36 teams were manually drawn and then automated software digitally drew their eight different opponents at random, determining which of their matches were at home and which ones away. Each team faced two opponents from each of the four pots, one at home and one away. Teams could not face opponents from their own association, and could only be drawn against a maximum of two sides from the same association.
Brest and Girona made their debut appearances in European football. Aston Villa, Bologna and Slovan Bratislava made their debut appearances since the introduction of the group stage.
A total of 16 national associations were represented in the league phase.


=== Table ===
The top eight ranked teams received a bye to the round of 16. The teams ranked from 9th to 24th will contest the knockout phase play-offs, with the teams ranked from 9th to 16th seeded for the draw. Teams ranked from 25th to 36th were eliminated from all competitions, with no access to the 2024–25 UEFA Europa League.


=== Results ===


== Knockout phase ==

In the knockout phase, teams will play against each other over two legs on a home-and-away basis, except for the one-match final. The bracket structure for the knockout phase is partially fixed in advance using seeding, with teams' positions in the bracket determined by the final standings in the league phase.
In the knockout phase, there is no country protection, with teams from the same association able to face each other in any round. Teams can also face opponents they played during the league phase.
The mechanism of the draws for each round is as follows:

In the draw for the knockout phase play-offs, the eight teams finishing the league phase in positions 9–16 are seeded, and the eight teams finishing the league phase in positions 17–24 are unseeded. The draw is split into four sections based on the predetermined bracket, with the seeded teams in each section drawn against one of their two possible unseeded opponents. The seeded teams host the second leg.
In the draw for the round of 16, the eight teams finishing the league phase in positions 1–8 are seeded, and the eight winners of the knockout phase play-offs are unseeded. Again, the draw is split into four sections based on the predetermined bracket, with the seeded teams in each section drawn against one of their two possible unseeded opponents. The seeded teams host the second leg.
In the quarter-finals and semi-finals, the exact match pairings are predetermined based on the tournament bracket. A draw is conducted only to determine which team plays the first leg at home. A draw is also held to determine which semi-final winner is designated as the "home" team for the final (for administrative purposes as it is played at a neutral venue).
