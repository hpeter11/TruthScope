The 2023 NFL draft was the 88th annual meeting of National Football League (NFL) franchises to select newly eligible players for the 2023 season. The draft was held outside of Union Station in Kansas City, Missouri, from April 27–29, 2023.
The Chicago Bears originally owned the first pick for the first time since 1947 before trading it prior to the draft to the Carolina Panthers for multiple draft picks and wide receiver D. J. Moore. The Panthers selected Alabama quarterback Bryce Young first overall and the Los Angeles Rams selected Desjuan Johnson with the final pick.


== Host city and events ==
Kansas City was chosen as the host city on May 22, 2019. Prior to the start of the draft, the NFL paid tribute to the three victims of the 2022 University of Virginia shooting, who were named honorary draft picks for their favorite teams, the Jacksonville Jaguars, Baltimore Ravens, and Miami Dolphins, respectively. The NFL Draft House Band, Lost Wax Band, was selected to entertain the NFL Draft crowd for all three nights.

== 2020 Resolution JC-2A selections ==
Since 2021, the league under 2020 Resolution JC-2A rewards teams for developing minority candidates for head coach or general manager positions. The resolution rewards teams whose minority candidates are hired away for one of those positions by awarding draft selections, which are at the end of the third round, after standard compensatory selections; if multiple teams qualify, they are awarded by draft order in the first round. These picks are in addition to, and have no impact on, the standard 32 compensatory selections. Five picks were awarded for the 2023 draft pursuant to the resolution. 


== Supplemental draft ==
A supplemental draft was held on July 11, 2023. For each player selected in the supplemental draft, the team forfeits its pick in that round in the draft of the following season. It was the first time the event had taken place since 2019.
Although two players – Milton Wright and Malachi Wideman – were eligible, neither was selected.
