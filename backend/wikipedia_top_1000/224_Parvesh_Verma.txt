== Political career ==


=== Early political involvements ===
Verma was interested in contesting for the West Delhi Lok Sabha Constituency in the 2009 general election but was denied a ticket by the party despite receiving assurances from party leaders that he would be considered. Instead Jagdish Mukhi of Janakpuri MLA contested West Delhi. A mahapanchayat held on 22 March 2009 in Dwarka "[condemned] the decision of the BJP to deny Parvesh the ticket".


=== Election debut ===
On 7 November 2013, the BJP announced Verma as the party's candidate from Mehrauli constituency for the 2013 Legislative Assembly election.  The mayor of the South Delhi Municipal Corporation, Sarita Chaudhary, and senior BJP Leader Sher Singh Dagar, the BJP candidate for Mehrauli in the 2008 election, both wanted to contest the same seat. Supporters of both the aspirants opposed Verma's candidature. Chaudhary's supporters protested outside the Delhi BJP headquarters and called Verma an "outsider". His mother and wife campaigned for him in the constituency. He was also made a member of the Delhi BJP Election Committee for the 2013 assembly election. He defeated runner-up Narinder Singh Sejwal of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) by 4,564 votes, and the incumbent MLA and Speaker of the Delhi Vidhan Sabha, Yoganand Shastri. 


=== Member of parliament ===
In 2014 Indian general election, Verma won the election for the West Delhi Lok Sabha Constituency by a record margin of 2,68,586 votes. Verma won a second term as MP in West Delhi with a record-breaking margin of 5.78 lakh votes, beating Congress's Mahabal Mishra, who got 2,87,162 votes. Verma broke his own record for the highest victory margin in Delhi and the 6th highest in India. In the 2019 General Elections, Verma got 8,65,648 of the total 14,41,601 votes polled in the seat. This is the highest recorded margin in the history of Delhi that any Lok Sabha candidate had ever won by. 
He became a member of the Joint Committee on Salaries and Allowances of Members of Parliament and of the Standing Committee on Urban Development. He also served on the governing body of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi. Currently, he is a member of the Estimates Committee and the Parliament Finance Committee.

== Controversies ==
During the 2020 Delhi Legislative Assembly election campaigning, Verma openly told people gathered at the Shaheen Bagh protests that if the BJP is voted to power in Delhi, it will clear them off within one hour. He also stated Muslims  such as those present at the Shaheen Bagh protests were known to "enter Hindu houses, rape our sisters and daughters".
Before the first phase of 2022 Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly election, Verma made a controversial offer of post-poll alliance with BJP to Rashtriya Lok Dal's Jayant Chaudhary after hosting a meeting of Home Minister Amit Shah with Jat leaders from Western UP; and Verma also told the mediapersons that Jayant, who was in alliance with the Samajwadi Party, had "chosen a wrong home".
Verma has also called for the 'total boycott' of Muslims at a recent rally organised by the VHP.
