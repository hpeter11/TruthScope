The 2023 season was the Kansas City Chiefs' 54th season in the National Football League (NFL), their 64th overall and their eleventh under head coach Andy Reid.
The Chiefs, who entered the season as defending champions, became the first team to repeat as Super Bowl champions since the New England Patriots in 2003 and 2004 along with being the second AFC West team to repeat as Super Bowl champions since rival Denver Broncos in 1997 and 1998.  Although they failed to improve on their 14–3 record from the previous season, they secured their eleventh consecutive winning season, and became division champions for the eighth consecutive season and a record 16th title overall. The overall record was 11–6, their least successful record under quarterback Patrick Mahomes. Four of the losses came at home. In total, Chiefs scored 39 touchdowns during the regular season compared to 61 in the previous season. This meant the team fell in scoring from top of the league to right in the middle of the NFL.
In the playoffs, Chiefs defeated the Miami Dolphins by 26–7 in the wildcard round in frigid weather. In the divisional round, the team held on to a narrow 27–24 win over the Buffalo Bills on the road. This was the Chiefs third playoff win in four years over the Bills. They made their sixth consecutive AFC Championship Game appearance, but their first on the road, defeating the Baltimore Ravens 17–10 to advance to their fourth Super Bowl in five years. They defeated the San Francisco 49ers 25–22 in overtime in Super Bowl LVIII, which was only the second overtime in Super Bowl history (the first was Super Bowl LI) and a rematch of Super Bowl LIV. The win moved the Chiefs to four Super Bowl titles, becoming the seventh franchise to accomplish that number.
The Chiefs defense was a key part of their Super Bowl-winning season, as they had a 2nd ranked defense in terms of yardage and points per game, only behind the Ravens. Despite all four of their opponents in the playoffs having scoring offenses that finished in the top 10 in the NFL, the Chiefs only allowed 15.8 points per game in the playoffs. Patrick Mahomes won his third Super Bowl MVP with two touchdown passes, including the decisive play in overtime. This marked Mahomes' third Super Bowl title in his first six years starting for the Chiefs. With the team having trailed by ten points in the second quarter, it also marked the third time in the Reid/Mahomes era the Chiefs overcame a double-digit Super Bowl deficit to win the title.
The Kansas City Chiefs drew an average home attendance of 70,968 in 9 home games in the 2023 NFL season.
