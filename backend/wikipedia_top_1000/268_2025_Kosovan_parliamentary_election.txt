Parliamentary elections were held in Kosovo on 9 February 2025 to elect the 120 members of the Assembly. Preliminary results showed that no party had won a majority, with the ruling Vetëvendosje party of Prime Minister Albin Kurti winning a plurality of votes cast.


== Background ==
In the 2021 elections Lëvizja Vetëvendosje (LVV) won 58 seats. They created a coalition with minority parties to form a Government. The government was the first since Kosovo's independence in 2008 to complete a full four-year mandate.


== Electoral system ==
The 120 members of the Assembly are elected by open list proportional representation for a four-year term, with 20 reserved for national minorities. Seats are allocated using the Sainte-Laguë method with an electoral threshold of 5%.


=== Election date ===
According to the constitution, parliamentary elections must be held no later than 30 days and no earlier than 45 days prior to the expiration of the outgoing parliament's mandate. On 31 July 2024, President Vjosa Osmani formally invited the leaders of political parties to a consultative meeting regarding the scheduling of the upcoming elections. In her invitation, Osmani underscored that, in accordance with the constitution and the electoral code, the elections must take place between 26 January and 16 February 2025. Opposition figures, including Lumir Abdixhiku of the Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK), Ramush Haradinaj of the Alliance for the Future of Kosovo (AAK) and Memli Krasniqi of the Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK), advocated for elections on 26 January, while Mimoza Kusari-Lila of the Alternativa proposed delaying the elections to 9 or 16 February, citing logistical concerns related to the post-holiday period. Prime Minister and leader of Vetëvendosje (LVV) Albin Kurti did not attend the consultation due to a prior commitment. Concluding, on 16 August, Osmani announced that the elections would be scheduled for 9 February 2025.


== Parties and coalitions ==
The application period for political parties seeking certification and submission of candidate lists for the 2025 elections spanned from 1 September to 11 December 2024. A total of 28 political entities submitted applications, including 20 political parties, five coalitions, two civil initiatives, and one independent candidate, with 1,280 candidates nominated for the elections. 
On 23 December 2024 the Serb List was not certified by the KQZ for participation in the elections. The decision was based on remarks made by the party's leader Zlatan Elek during the presentation of the electoral list, which KQZ deemed to be nationalistic in nature. The party said it would appeal the decision, calling it “institutional and political violence” against the Serb minority. On 25 December 2024, the Election Complaints and Appeals Panel (ECAP) accepted the Serb List's appeal against the KQZ decision to deny their certification for participation in the upcoming parliamentary elections in Kosovo. ECAP instructed the KQZ to certify the Serb List for the election.
The Election Commission published the official list of the 28 participating parties and coalitions.


== Campaign ==
Election campaigns in Kosovo are regulated to start 30 days before the scheduled election date and must conclude on the day before the election.


=== Governmental parties ===
In August 2024 the governing parties of Vetëvendosje, Guxo and Alternativa announced that they would once again run inside the same electoral list, with incumbent Prime Minister Albin Kurti leading the list. Although initial reports suggested that Guxo! and Alternativa preferred a formal coalition.
There has been some infighting within Guxo! against their leaders Donika Gërvalla-Schwarz and Faton Peci, both of whom are ministers within the Government. On 9 December 2024 Guxo! branch in Ferizaj announced it would close itself that day, citing discontent with its leaders. On 12 December Guxo! branch in Peja called for voters to boycott the election following the publication of the deputy list, which according to them broke party rules by not including party name on the list.


=== Opposition parties ===
On 27 March 2024 the Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK) announced that Bedri Hamza, mayor of South Mitrovica and Former Minister of Finance, would be its candidate for Prime Minister. The move to nominate Hamza has been speculated as an attempt to focus the campaign on the Economy, which has seen stagnation under the new government. On November 3 during the convention of PDK, Hamza announced their slogan would be "Kosova mundet më mirë"(Kosovo can do better). Hamza also announced his plans and projects for governing Kosovo, with the economy being the main point of his program.
In December 2023 the Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK) published its program from the upcoming election dubbed "Rruga e re" ("The New Road", "The New Path" or "The New Way"). In July 2024 LDK and PSHDK, a Christian minority party in Kosovo, announced that they would run together in the same electoral list. Lumir Abdixhiku is its candidate for Prime Minister, serving as leader of LDK since 2021.
In January 2024 opposition parties Alliance for the Future of Kosovo (AAK), Social Democratic Initiative (NISMA) and Conservative List of Kosovo (LKK) announced they would run together in a coalition led by leader of AAK and former Prime Minister, Ramush Haradinaj. According to the Social Democratic Party of Kosovo (PSD) it too was offered to join this coalition but rejected it due to ideological differences. The coalition was made official in August 2024 and soon after, the coalition published their program which focuses more on foreign relations and Kosovo's aspiration to join NATO and EU.
The New Kosovo Alliance (AKR) and the Justice Party (PD) along with assembly members of ruling LVV announced the creation of the "Family List" Coalition. The coalition was formed as opposition to the government attempt to increase LGBTQ rights in Kosovo, specifically the proposed Civil Code which would've legalized same-sex civil unions.


=== Campaign issues ===


==== Dialogue with Serbia ====
Following the formation of the government Prime Minister Kurti declared that dialogue with Serbia would be his 6th or 7th priority, choosing to focus more on domestic issues. On 20 September 2021 Kosovo announced a ban on Serbian license plates being used by Serbian citizens in Kosovo. The Government justified this action as reciprocal measures, seeing as Serbia doesn't recognize Kosovan license plates. This however sparked protest in Serb-majority north Kosovo as well as condemnation from Serbia who threatened to use military action. On 30 September 2021 EU had announced they had brokered a temporary deal between Serbia and Kosovo, halting the issue for 6 months.
In July 2022 Kosovan government announced that Serbian citizens who enter Kosovo will receive entry and exit documents sparking barricades by local Serbs in Kosovo. This would also lead to Serbian politicians and policemen to leave Kosovan Institutions.


==== LGBTQ rights ====
The issue of regulating marriage and civil partnerships for same-sex couples has sparked a clash of viewpoints in the Kosovo Assembly. In March 2022, the Civil Code Draft did not pass its first reading due to strong opposition, particularly regarding the potential legalization of civil partnerships between same-sex individuals. The proposed law would allow for the creation of a separate legal framework to register "civil partnerships" for same-sex couples, but it faced significant opposition from lawmakers and religious leaders, who view it as a redefinition of marriage and family. LGBT community supporters have called for equal recognition of marriage rights, emphasizing that Kosovo's Constitution guarantees the right to marry for all citizens. In April 2024, Kosovo's Prime Minister Albin Kurti announced plans to pass a new Civil Code in May, which included provisions for civil partnerships between same-sex couples. This would have made Kosovo the third country in the Western Balkans, after Croatia and Montenegro, to legally recognize such unions. However, the vote did not take place in May, and the process has been delayed indefinitely. The proposal faced opposition from some members of Kurti's party and religious leaders in Kosovo, who argued it would redefine marriage and family. The draft defines marriage as a legally recognized union between a man and a woman but allows for civil partnerships between same-sex couples. Despite the delay, Prime Minister Kurti has stated that the legislation will eventually pass.


== Observers ==
The European Union established a team of 100 observers led by French MEP Nathalie Loiseau to monitor the election.
