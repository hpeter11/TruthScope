The NFL championships describes both the Championship games of the National Football League, which ran from 1920 to 1969; and the Super Bowl, which has run from 1966 to the present. Many players and teams have won these championships on multiple occasions, both during the NFL championships and the Super Bowl era. The majority of these players were on the Green Bay Packers between 1960 and 1967, a period in which the Packers won three NFL championships and the first two Super Bowl games.
