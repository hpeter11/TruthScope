The 2025 ICC Champions Trophy  will be the ninth edition of the ICC Champions Trophy, a cricket tournament for the eight top-ranked One Day International teams in the world. It will be hosted by Pakistan and United Arab Emirates from 19 February to 9 March 2025 and will be contested by the top eight ranked men's national teams qualified from the 2023 Cricket World Cup. Pakistan are the defending champions, having won the previous edition in 2017.


== Background ==
The ICC Champions Trophy is a quadrennial ODI cricket tournament organised by the International Cricket Council (ICC). Initially held as a biennial tournament since its inaugural edition in 1998 as ICC KnockOut Trophy, it was rebranded as ICC Champions Trophy in 2002 and has been held as a quadrennial tournament since 2009. In 2016, the ICC cancelled future editions of the Champions Trophy after the 2017 tournament, aiming to have only one major tournament in each format of international cricket. However in November 2021 as part of the 2024–2031 ICC men's hosts cycle, ICC announced that the tournament would return from 2025 onwards.


=== Host selection ===
Pakistan was announced as the host of the 2025 ICC Champions Trophy on 16 November 2021 as part of the 2024–2031 ICC men's hosts cycle. It will be the first global tournament to be hosted by Pakistan after 28 years, since the 2009 attack on the Sri Lankan team. The last major tournament to take place in the country was the 1996 Cricket World Cup which it co-hosted with India and Sri Lanka. United Arab Emirates was announced as a co-host due to India's refusal to play in Pakistan. Only the matches involving India will be played in UAE.


=== Format ===
Eight qualified teams divided into two groups of four, will play against the three teams in their respective group – for a total of twelve matches – and the top two teams in each group will advance to the knockout stage. The knockout stage will consist of 2 semi-finals and a final. A total of 15 matches will be played over 19 days.


=== India's participation ===

The India–Pakistan cricket rivalry has been severely impacted by the tense political relations between the two nations. In November 2023, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) met with the ICC Executive Board to discuss compensation if India refused to play in Pakistan. A year later, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) informed the ICC that India wouldn't travel to Pakistan for the tournament, citing security concerns. Pakistan demanded a written explanation and initially rejected the proposed hybrid model.


==== Neutral venue arrangements ====
On 19 December 2024, following an agreement between BCCI and PCB, the ICC in an update issued on India and Pakistan hosted matches at ICC events, established that the upcoming ICC Champions Trophy set to be played in February and March 2025 will be played across Pakistan and a neutral venue. The ICC board confirmed that India and Pakistan matches hosted by either country at ICC events between 2024 and 2027 would be played at a neutral venue. This will apply also to the 2025 Women's Cricket World Cup (hosted by India; but only if Pakistan qualifies for the tournament) and the 2026 Men's T20 World Cup (hosted by India and Sri Lanka). It was also announced that Pakistan had been awarded hosting rights of the 2028 Women's T20 World Cup, where neutral venue arrangements will also apply. The fixtures were announced on 24 December 2024, along with the Dubai International Cricket Stadium in Dubai, UAE as the neutral venue for the tournament.


=== Marketing ===
On 13 November 2024, The ICC launched a brand-new visual identity for the Champions Trophy with the release of a brand launch video, as the men’s event will return for the first time since 2017. On 14 November 2024, The PCB announced the schedule for trophy tour in the cities of Skardu, Hunza, and Muzaffarabad, located in the region of  Pakistan-administered Kashmir. The PCB's plan to take the trophy to cities in Pakistan-administered Kashmir cities was objected to by the BCCI. On 16 November 2024, the ICC officially announced the global trophy tour for the Champions Trophy starting in Islamabad, with the cities in Pakistan-administered Kashmir excluded. The prestigious silverware journeyed across the eight participating nations. The global trophy tour will conclude with India in January, as the trophy goes back to Pakistan.
On 30 January 2025, it was announced that a captains' event would not be held for the tournament. The official theme song for the tournament titled "Jeeto Baazi Khel Ke" performed by Atif Aslam was released on 7 February 2025.


== Qualification ==
Pakistan qualified for the competition automatically as hosts and was joined by seven other highest-ranked teams from the 2023 Cricket World Cup group stage. This was the first time former champions Sri Lanka failed to qualify for the tournament, while Afghanistan will make their debut appearance in the tournament.


== Venues ==
In December 2022, the Pakistan Cricket Board was given approval by the Government of Pakistan for the construction of a new cricket stadium in Islamabad for the tournament. On 28 April 2024, three existing venues were proposed for the event by Pakistan. The matches will be hosted in Karachi, Lahore and Rawalpindi with India playing in Dubai.
