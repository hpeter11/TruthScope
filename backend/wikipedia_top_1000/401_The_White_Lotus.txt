The White Lotus is an American black comedy drama anthology television series created by Mike White for HBO. It follows the guests and employees of the fictional White Lotus resort chain, whose interactions are affected by their various psychosocial dysfunctions. The press release notes that "each passing day, a darker complexity emerges in these picture-perfect travelers, the hotel's cheerful employees, and the idyllic locale itself". The first and second season are set in Hawaii and Sicily, respectively. The third season was filmed in Thailand.
Intended as a 6-part limited series, The White Lotus premiered on July 11, 2021, to critical acclaim and high ratings. The show's success led to HBO renewing it as an anthology series; a second season premiered on October 30, 2022. In November 2022, the series was renewed for a third season which is set to premiere on February 16, 2025. In January 2025, prior to the premiere of season 3, the show was renewed for a fourth season. 
The series received critical acclaim. It was included on the American Film Institute's list of the ten best programs of 2021 and 2022, and it received various accolades, including 15 Primetime Emmy Awards and 2 Golden Globes.

=== Development ===
On October 19, 2020, HBO gave The White Lotus a limited series order that consisted of six episodes. The series was created, written and directed by Mike White. White also serves as executive producer alongside David Bernad and Nick Hall. On August 10, 2021, HBO renewed the series for a second season, which consists of seven episodes. On November 18, 2022, HBO renewed the series for a third season. The third season's production was disrupted by the 2023 Writers Guild of America strike, resulting in the release being pushed to 2025. On January 22, 2025, ahead of the third season premiere, HBO renewed the series for a fourth season.

Upon the announcement of the second season renewal, HBO announced that a predominantly new cast of characters would be focused on at another White Lotus property for the second season, though Mike White had stated there was a possibility for a few cast members from the first season to return as their characters.
