Jameis Lanaed Winston ( JAY-miss; born January 6, 1994) is an American professional football quarterback for the Cleveland Browns of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Florida State Seminoles, becoming the youngest player to win the Heisman Trophy and leading his team to victory in the 2014 BCS National Championship Game during his freshman year. Declaring for the NFL after his sophomore season, Winston was selected first overall by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the 2015 NFL draft.
Winston set several franchise rookie records for the Buccaneers, earning him Pro Bowl honors, and led the league in passing yards during the 2019 season. However, he was unable to reach the playoffs with Tampa Bay and his 2019 campaign was also marked with him leading the league in interceptions, including setting the NFL season record for interceptions returned for touchdowns. After his rookie contract with the Buccaneers expired, Winston joined Tampa Bay's NFL South divisional rival New Orleans Saints, where he alternated as a starter and backup for four seasons. He later signed a one-year deal with the Cleveland Browns, where he became a starter after an injury to Deshaun Watson.


== Early life ==
Winston was born in Bessemer, Alabama, on January 6, 1994. He attended Hueytown High School, where he played both football and baseball. Winston was considered the best dual-threat quarterback recruit in the nation by Rivals.com, and the best overall quarterback recruit by ESPN. Winston was also named the MVP of the ESPN RISE Elite 11 quarterback camp. Additionally, Winston earned the Gatorade Player of the Year recognition for the state of Alabama.
Winston committed to attend Florida State University on February 3, 2012. The Texas Rangers selected Winston in the 15th round of the 2012 Major League Baseball Draft out of high school. Though the Rangers proposed allowing him to play for the Florida State Seminoles football team while working out with their baseball organization, Winston decided not to sign.

== Professional career ==


=== Tampa Bay Buccaneers ===


==== 2015 season ====

The Tampa Bay Buccaneers took Winston first overall in the 2015 NFL draft. On May 1, 2015, Winston signed a four-year, $23.35 million contract with the Buccaneers, with a $16.7 million signing bonus. The contract prevented him from playing any other sport than football.
Winston played his first regular season game against the Tennessee Titans that featured fellow first rounder, Marcus Mariota. In the 42–14 loss, his first pass was intercepted and returned for a touchdown by Coty Sensabaugh. Winston's interception was the first time a rookie's first pass was returned for a touchdown since Brett Favre in 1991.
On November 22, 2015, against the Philadelphia Eagles, Winston tied an NFL rookie, and Buccaneers franchise, record with five touchdown passes.
Winston set franchise rookie records in pass attempts, pass completions, passing yards, and passing touchdowns. Winston finished his rookie season with 4,042 passing yards, finishing 23 yards short of the franchise record set by Josh Freeman in 2012. Winston also became the third rookie quarterback to pass over 4,000 yards in a season. He was named to the NFL All-Rookie Team for his 2015 season, becoming the fourth Buccaneers quarterback to receive this award, joining Tom Owen (1974), Doug Williams (1978), and Mike Glennon (2013).
New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady elected not to participate in the 2016 Pro Bowl following his team's loss in the AFC Championship game; as a result, Winston was selected to his first Pro Bowl game making him the first rookie quarterback in Buccaneers' history to be selected.


==== 2016 season ====

Winston's second season in the NFL began with an impressive performance against the Atlanta Falcons at the Georgia Dome, in which he completed over 70% of his throws for 281 yards and four touchdown passes in a 31–24 victory. He earned National Football Conference (NFC) Offensive Player of the Week for his performance against the Falcons. Following Week 1, the Buccaneers began to struggle through injuries, inconsistent play, and offensive turnovers till mid-season, at which point the team was 3–5 and had experienced blowout losses to the Arizona Cardinals, Denver Broncos, and Atlanta Falcons – a three-game losing streak. Following the loss to the Falcons, the Winston-led Buccaneers began playing efficient offense as well as exceptional defense and special teams play, resulting in the Buccaneers' first five-game winning streak since their Super Bowl-winning season. The win streak gave the Buccaneers possession of the 6th seed in the NFC playoff race, which they quickly lost after back-to-back losses to the Dallas Cowboys and New Orleans Saints. Winston led the Buccaneers to their first winning season in six years after defeating the Carolina Panthers in the regular-season finale, during which he broke the franchise records for passing yards and passing touchdowns in a season and became the first quarterback in NFL history to start his career with consecutive seasons of 4,000 yards passing. However, the Buccaneers were eliminated from playoff contention via a tiebreaker with the Detroit Lions. He was ranked 57th by his peers on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2017.


==== 2017 season ====

During Week 6 against the Cardinals, Winston left the game with an apparent right shoulder injury. The next day, October 16, Winston suffered a sprained AC joint in his right shoulder, but he stated that he could play through it. During Week 9's loss to the Saints, Winston was taken out of the game with the same shoulder injury. Head coach Dirk Koetter announced the next day that he would miss at least two weeks to rest his shoulder. While on the sideline, Winston initiated an altercation with Saints rookie Marshon Lattimore, while being assisted by teammate Mike Evans, for which Winston was fined $12,154. In the game, Winston became the second-youngest player in NFL history to reach 10,000 career passing yards, four days older than record holder Drew Bledsoe. He missed the next three games due to injury and returned in Week 13. Overall, Winston and Buccaneers struggled to a 5–11 record. Winston finished the 2017 season with 3,504 passing yards, 19 touchdowns, and 11 interceptions.


==== 2018 season ====

On April 17, 2018, the Buccaneers picked up the fifth-year option on Winston's contract. On June 21, the NFL announced that he would be suspended for violating the league's personal conduct policy, regarding his latest incident where he allegedly groped a female Uber driver. On June 28, the announcement was made official, giving Winston a three-game suspension to begin the 2018 season.
After missing the first three games due to the suspension, Winston returned in Week 4 against the Chicago Bears, but did not start. He replaced Ryan Fitzpatrick in the third quarter, finishing with 145 passing yards, a touchdown, and two interceptions as the Buccaneers lost 10–48. In Week 6, against the Falcons, he had 395 passing yards, four touchdowns, and two interceptions in the 34–29 loss. In Week 8 against the Cincinnati Bengals, Winston threw for 276 yards, one touchdown, and four interceptions and he was benched in the third quarter for Fitzpatrick. During Week 11 against the New York Giants, Fitzpatrick threw three interceptions and was benched for Winston in the second half. Winston threw for 199 yards, two touchdowns, and an interception as the Buccaneers lost 38–35. Two weeks later, in a 24–17 win over the Panthers, Winston completed 20 of 30 passing attempts for 249 yards and two touchdowns, breaking the franchise record for passing touchdowns in a career with 81. Three weeks later, in a 27–20 loss to the Cowboys, Winston completed 34 of 48 passing attempts for 336 yards and one touchdown, breaking the franchise record for completions in a career previously held by Josh Freeman. Overall, he finished the 2018 season with 2,992 passing yards, 19 touchdowns, and 14 interceptions.


==== 2019 season ====

Prior to the start of the season, head coach Dirk Koetter was fired and replaced by former Cardinals head coach Bruce Arians. In Week 1, during a 31–17 loss to the San Francisco 49ers, Winston broke the Buccaneers franchise record for passing yards in a career previously held by Vinny Testaverde but finished with 194 passing yards, one touchdown, and three interceptions, two of which were returned for touchdowns. Following a lackluster first two weeks of the 2019 season, during a 32–31 loss to the Giants in Week 3, Winston passed for 380 yards, three touchdowns, and one interception. The following week, Winston passed for 385 yards, four touchdowns, and an interception in a 55–40 win over the Los Angeles Rams. As a result of his performance, Winston was named NFC Offensive Player of the Week.
During Week 6 against the Panthers at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, Winston became the first quarterback in Buccaneers franchise history to pass for 100 touchdowns in a career, but finished with 400 passing yards, one touchdown, a lost fumble, and a career-high five interceptions as the Buccaneers lost 37–26. Two weeks later, in a 27–23 loss to the Titans, Winston broke another Buccaneers franchise record, previously held by Testaverde, for career passing attempts, but finished with 301 yards, two touchdowns, two interceptions, and two lost fumbles. The following week, in a 40–34 overtime loss to the Seattle Seahawks, Winston passed for 335 yards, two touchdowns, and lost a fumble. In Week 10, during a 30–27 victory over the Cardinals, he had 358 passing yards, one touchdown, and two interceptions.

In Week 12, during a 35–22 win against the Falcons, Winston passed for 313 yards, three touchdowns, and two interceptions. During Week 14 against the Indianapolis Colts, Winston finished with a then career-best 456 passing yards, five rushing yards, five total touchdowns, and three interceptions as the Buccaneers won 38–35. As a result of his performance, Winston broke the Buccaneers' single-season franchise record for passing yards that he set in 2016, becoming the first quarterback in franchise history to pass for over 4,100 yards in a season.
In Week 15, during a 38–17 win over the Lions, Winston finished with a career-best 458 passing yards, four rushing yards, four touchdowns, and one interception as he both became the first quarterback in NFL history to have consecutive games of 450 passing yards and broke the franchise record for passing touchdowns in a single season that he set in 2016, becoming the first quarterback in franchise history to throw 30 passing touchdowns in a single season. In Week 16, during a 23–20 loss to the Houston Texans, Winston threw for 335 yards, one touchdown, and four interceptions with one returned for a touchdown. In Week 17, during a 28–22 overtime loss to the Falcons, Winston threw for 201 yards, two touchdowns, and two interceptions including a game-ending one that was returned for a touchdown by linebacker Deion Jones. As a result, Winston became the eighth quarterback in NFL history to throw for 5,000 yards in a single season, the first Buccaneers quarterback to throw for 5,000 yards in a single season, and the first quarterback in NFL history to throw at least 30 touchdowns and 30 interceptions in a single season.
Winston finished his fifth year setting new career highs, leading the league in passing yards, completions, and attempts to go along with new career highs in passing touchdowns but also leading the league in interceptions and total turnovers. He finished with 5,109 passing yards, 33 passing touchdowns, one rushing touchdown, 30 interceptions, and five lost fumbles. Winston's seven interceptions returned for touchdowns set an NFL record, and his 84.3 passer rating ranked 27th among starters. Winston was also recognized for having his first and last pass as a Buccaneer returned for touchdowns.
On February 28, 2020, it was revealed that Winston underwent surgery to repair a torn meniscus. It was also revealed that Winston had LASIK surgery. Furthermore, he was dealing with the knee injury and a broken thumb for the entire 2019 season. Winston was not re-signed by the Buccaneers in the offseason, as they opted to replace him with longtime New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady.

==== 2020 season ====

On April 28, 2020, Winston signed a one-year contract with the Saints. His contract had a value of $1.1 million including his base salary of $952,000 and a signing bonus of $148,000 with a possible $3.4 million in incentives.
Winston made his first appearance of the 2020 season in Week 9 against his former team the Buccaneers on Sunday Night Football in relief of Brees. Winston passed for 12 yards as the Saints beat the Bucs 38–3. In Week 10 against the 49ers, Winston came in the second half after Brees left the game with a rib injury. Winston completed 6 of 10 passes for 63 yards as the Saints won 27–13. He was placed on the reserve/COVID-19 list by the team on December 20, 2020, and activated four days later.

On March 20, 2024, Winston signed a one-year deal with the Cleveland Browns. 
After starting quarterback Deshaun Watson was ruled out for the season with an Achilles tear on October 20, Winston took over as the starter beginning in Week 8. In his first start, Winston threw for 334 yards, three touchdowns, and zero interceptions, including a go-ahead touchdown with under a minute left as he led Cleveland to a 29–24 upset victory over the Baltimore Ravens. In Week 11 against the Saints, Winston threw for 395 yards and two touchdowns, including a career-long 89-yard touchdown pass to Jerry Jeudy as the Browns lost 35–14. The following week against the Pittsburgh Steelers, Winston scrambled for a two-yard touchdown to give Cleveland a 12-point lead in snowy conditions. The Browns squandered that lead after a pair of turnovers from Winston in the fourth quarter, but he rallied Cleveland to a game-winning drive with under a minute left to win 24–19.
In Week 13 against the Denver Broncos, Winston set a Browns single-game record with 497 passing yards and four touchdowns, but his three interceptions, including two returned for touchdowns, doomed the Browns as they lost 41–32.

=== Controversies ===


==== Sexual assault allegation ====
On November 14, 2013, the State Attorney of the Second Judicial Circuit announced they were opening an investigation into a sexual assault allegation involving Winston that was originally filed with the Tallahassee Police Department (TPD) on December 7, 2012. The complaint was originally investigated by the police and classified as open/inactive in February 2013 with no charges being filed. The police report, containing the complainant's original statement, has been posted by the Tallahassee Police Department. Tallahassee police stated that the complaint was made inactive "when the victim in the case broke off contact with TPD, and her attorney indicated she did not want to move forward at that time" and then re-examined after media requests for information started coming in early November. On December 5, 2013, State Attorney Willie Meggs announced the completion of the investigation and that no charges would be filed against anyone in this case, citing "major issues" with the woman's testimony. Meggs stated that "As prosecutors, we only bring charges for cases where the evidence will result in a likely conviction at trial. In this case, the evidence does not show that." Allegations of improper police conduct have been made by both parties, with the complainant claiming to have been pressured into dropping her claim and Winston's attorney alleging inappropriate leaks to the media. Florida State's policy is that athletes charged with a felony cannot play until their case is resolved, but Winston continued to play throughout the investigation because he was never charged.
On April 16, 2014, The New York Times reported irregularities in the rape investigation involving Winston.  The complainant developed bruises and semen was found on her underwear. 34 days later, the complainant identified Winston by name as her attacker. Tallahassee police contacted Winston about 13 days later.  No DNA sample was taken from Winston until the prosecutor took over the case, months later; once it was taken in November 2013, it was found to match DNA found in the complainant's underwear. The investigation was conducted by Officer Scott Angulo, who, the Times' article notes, did private security work for the Seminole Boosters, the primary financier of Florida State athletics.
The official FSU hearing, presided over by retired Florida Supreme Court Justice Major B. Harding, on December 21, 2014, cleared Winston of violating the student conduct code in the sexual assault allegation. An extract from Harding's decision is below.

I do not find the credibility of one story substantially stronger than that of the other. Both have their own strengths and weaknesses. I cannot find with any confidence that the events as set forth by you, (accuser), or a particular combination thereof is more probable than not as required to find you responsible for a violation of the Code. Therein lies the determinative factor of my decision.
The accuser filed a civil suit against Winston in April 2014 and Winston countersued her for defamation and tortious interference in May 2014.  In a September 2015 ruling, federal judge Anne C. Conway dismissed Winston's tortious interference claim, but declined a motion to dismiss his claim for defamation.  These civil claims were settled out of court in December 2016, four months before the case was scheduled to go to trial.
In November 2015, Winston told CNN that he was prepared to file suit if the network aired The Hunting Ground, a documentary about college campus rape which includes disputed allegations about Winston. CNN was undeterred and aired the documentary on November 22, 2015.
In 2016, the university paid $950,000 to settle a lawsuit brought by the same woman alleging a violation of Title IX by FSU in handling her complaint.  The university also agreed to conduct five years of sexual awareness programs.  It did not admit liability.


==== Shoplifting incidents ====
In July 2013, a Burger King employee called police in July to complain that Winston was stealing soda. According to the police report, Winston came into the restaurant with three men, but did not order any food. An employee, who recognized him, first saw him using ketchup cups to take some soda. He asked for a water cup after she told him to stop, but he said he would use it for soda and filled it repeatedly with soda over her objections, the report said. On April 29, 2014, Winston was issued an adult civil citation for shoplifting crab legs from a Tallahassee Publix store. Winston was ordered to undergo 20 hours of community service, and was suspended from any college baseball activity until he completed his community service.


==== Vulgar comments ====
On September 17, 2014, Winston was suspended for the first half of Florida State's upcoming game against Clemson. The Guardian reported that "several students tweeted" that Winston shouted, "Fuck her right in the pussy!" an Internet meme, while standing atop a table in Florida State University's Student Union. Two days later, university president Garnett S. Stokes and athletic director Stan Wilcox, citing results of an "ongoing investigation", announced that Winston would be suspended for the whole game.


==== 2017 groping allegation ====
On November 17, 2017, it was reported that the NFL conducted an investigation, where Winston allegedly groped a female Uber driver in 2016. Two days later, it was revealed that Ronald Darby, who also attended Florida State, was also on board during the ride in which this incident supposedly occurred. Darby has defended Winston against the allegations. However, the investigation found evidence that Winston got into another Uber ride alone, which was consistent with the Uber driver's account, and concluded that Winston "violated the Personal Conduct Policy by touching the driver in an
inappropriate and sexual manner without her consent". The league announced on June 21 that it was suspending Winston for the first three games of the 2018 season as a result of his involvement in the incident, which it carried through on June 28.
