=== Development ===
On November 18, 2022, preceding the premiere of the second season, HBO renewed The White Lotus for a third season. Following the second-season finale, series creator Mike White hinted that the third season would be set in Asia and invoke a "satirical and funny look at death and Eastern religion and spirituality", similar to how the first season focused on money, and the second season on sex. The third season's production was disrupted by the 2023 Writers Guild of America strike, resulting in the release being pushed to 2025.


=== Casting ===
Upon the third-season renewal announcement, producers confirmed that there will be a new cast of characters in another White Lotus resort. In April 2023, Natasha Rothwell was reported to be reprising her role as Belinda for the series' third season. In January 2024, it was announced that Leslie Bibb, Jason Isaacs, Michelle Monaghan, Parker Posey, Dom Hetrakul, Tayme Thapthimthong, Carrie Coon, Miloš Biković, Christian Friedel, Morgana O'Reilly, Lek Patravadi, Shalini Peiris, Walton Goggins, Sarah Catherine Hook, Sam Nivola, Patrick Schwarzenegger, Aimee Lou Wood, Francesca Corney, Nicholas Duvernay, and Arnas Fedaravičius joined the cast for the season. Biković's casting was criticized by Ukraine's Ministry of Foreign Affairs over his alleged support for Russia's invasion of the country; Biković was subsequently dropped from the cast on February 2, and replaced with Julian Kostov, who will star in a recurring capacity. In February 2024, Scott Glenn and Lalisa Manobal were cast in the season. In March 2024, Charlotte Le Bon joined the cast to replace Corney in a re-casting.


=== Filming ===
In March 2023, Variety reported that filming for the third season was likely to take place in one of the Four Seasons hotels in Thailand. Honshu, Japan was scouted as a filming location by Mike White, but ultimately Thailand was chosen as the filming location for the third season due to the series receiving a $4.4 million tax incentive for filming in Thailand, while Japan does not have a film-incentive system. Principal photography began in February 2024, with locations including Bangkok, Phuket, and Ko Samui, and wrapped in August 2024.


== Release ==
The third season is scheduled to premiere on February 16, 2025, on HBO.
