== Professional career ==


=== Pre-draft ===
Coming out of Clemson, Hopkins was considered a top prospect and received an invitation to the NFL combine. He completed nearly all of the combine drills, but was unable to finish the three-cone drill after suffering an apparent calf injury. After the combine, the hotel room Hopkins shared with Rutgers wide receiver Mark Harrison was found to be left in a state where "urine and feces were found around the bathroom, toothpaste was left on the mirror and partially eaten food was on one of the beds," per ESPN. Both players denied responsibility.
On March 7, 2013, he participated in Clemson's pro day. Hopkins attended private workouts or visits with the Dallas Cowboys, Carolina Panthers, New England Patriots, and had two with the St. Louis Rams.

== Personal life ==

Hopkins' father died in a car accident when Hopkins was five months old, leaving his mother to raise him and his three siblings as a single mother. Hopkins credits his success to his mother, Sabrina Greenlee. 
In July 2002, Greenlee had a boiling concoction of lye and bleach thrown at her face by a woman her boyfriend had an affair with. The attack resulted in the skin rapidly peeling off her neck, face, and back and left her blind. Because of her inability to watch him play due to blindness, Hopkins started a tradition of giving touchdown balls to her immediately after scoring in an effort to remain close to her.
Hopkins' uncle on his mother's side, Terry Smith, played wide receiver at Clemson and went undrafted before having a brief professional career.
Hopkins is a Christian. He grew up going to church with his mother and was baptized one day after practice at Clemson in 2012. Hopkins has said, "My faith is a big, big thing for me. It is a major part of my life."
"No matter how hard life can get, you can never give up. Just work hard, live right, and have faith in the Lord."
During his time at Clemson, Hopkins majored in community recreation and sport & camp management. 
Hopkins holds a SMOOOTH Back-to-school giveaway that supplies book bags and school supplies for over 2,500 children. SMOOOTH is an acronym that stands for "Speaking Mentally Outwardly Opening Opportunities Towards Healing". In 2021, Hopkins went into the cereal business with "DeAndre's Hop Box". A portion of the proceeds of the cereal's sales went to the SMOOOTH Foundation.
In March 2020, Hopkins partnered with Beyond Meat. The partnership started the Feed A Million+ pledge with the intent to donate and distribute more than one million Beyond Burgers across the United States to needy people.
In 2020, Hopkins displayed the name of Denmark Vesey on his helmet as a tribute to the alleged mastermind of a thwarted 1822 South Carolina slave revolt. Hopkins chose Vesey due to their South Carolina heritage, to honor Vesey's sacrifice for equality, and to draw attention to a history that is not commonly taught.
