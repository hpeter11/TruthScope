=== Development ===
On March 26, 2024, Max gave production a 15-episode series order for The Pitt. The series is created and showrun by R. Scott Gemmill who is also an executive producer alongside Noah Wyle, John Wells, Erin Jontow, Simran Baidwan, and Michael Hissrich. Production companies involved with the series are John Wells Productions and Warner Bros. Television. The pilot is also written by Gemmill. On August 27, 2024, it was reported that the estate of Michael Crichton, represented by his widow Sherri, had sued Warner Bros. Television, Wells, Wyle, and Gemmill over breach of contract, claiming that The Pitt was a reworking of a planned sequel to ER that the estate had not approved, and that Crichton should be credited as creator. On November 4, 2024, Warner Bros. Television's lawyers responded to the lawsuit by filing for a motion to dismiss, claiming that it is "a completely different show".
