Benson James Boone (born June 25, 2002) is an American singer-songwriter. Born and raised in Monroe, Washington, he began his music career when he filled in for a friend at a talent show. Boone appeared on American Idol in early 2021, where he briefly competed before withdrawing voluntarily. He continued to gain popularity on TikTok and subsequently signed a contract with Night Street Records.
Boone's debut single, "Ghost Town", was released in October 2021 and charted in 16 countries. Boone has since released multiple successful singles, including "In the Stars" (April 2022) and "Beautiful Things" (January 2024), the latter topping the charts in the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland and New Zealand. It also became his first song to enter the top five on the U.S.  Billboard Hot 100, reaching number two. His debut studio album, Fireworks & Rollerblades, was released in April 2024.

Boone was born in Monroe, Washington, to Kerry and Nate Boone. Boone grew up with four sisters, Kaylee, Natalee, Emma, and Claire. He attended Monroe High School and was a member of the school's competitive diving team. He graduated from the school in 2020. 
Boone discovered his musical talent when a friend asked him to play the piano and sing in their high school's battle of the bands during his junior year. He had previously had no experience as a vocalist. 
He briefly attended Brigham Young University–Idaho, a private college owned and operated by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, of which he is a member. He studied at the Rexburg, Idaho campus for one semester before pausing his studies to focus on music.


== Career ==

Boone drew early musical inspiration from attending a Jon Bellion concert, after which he began taking singing seriously. On a friend's recommendation,  he began posting singing videos to TikTok and auditioned for season 19 of American Idol in early 2021. Boone was invited in advance to the show's Hollywood Week, but he withdrew from the competition just after winning a place in the Top 24 to focus on his career instead. His Hollywood Week performances were not televised.
Boone began sharing snippets of his original music on TikTok, where he amassed 1.7 million followers prior to the release of his first single. He caught the attention of Imagine Dragons frontman Dan Reynolds, who signed Boone to his record label Night Street Records in partnership with Warner Records. They announced the deal on October 15, 2021, with the release of Boone's first single, "Ghost Town". Boone played drums, guitar, and piano on the recording, in addition to designing the artwork for the single. Boone performed the song on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, The Kelly Clarkson Show, and Late Night with Seth Meyers in the United States; it later charted in 14 countries, including the Billboard Hot 100 in the U.S.
Boone released his second single, "Room for 2", on February 18, 2022. In May 2024, Taylor Swift announced on social media that Boone was one of three artists opening for the London shows of her Eras Tour at Wembley Stadium, alongside Paramore. Boone opened for Swift's June 23 show, with Mette and Griff opening for the June 21 and 22 shows, respectively.
