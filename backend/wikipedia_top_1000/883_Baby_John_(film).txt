=== Development ===
Two months after the release of Theri (2016), it was reported that the film would be remade in Hindi with Rohit Shetty, directing the venture and Shah Rukh Khan and Akshay Kumar as the frontrunners to play the leads. However, Shetty denied the plans of remaking the film. In late April 2020, reports of a potential Hindi remake being planned with Varun Dhawan being approached to play the lead role. However, it was undisclosed whether Atlee, the director of the original film, would direct the venture or give the role to someone else. Reportedly, the director had met the actor in Mumbai during 2019 to discuss the possibilities of a possible collaboration in the near future. However, no development took place until in early March 2022, as Dhawan had reportedly completed his existing commitments, he met Atlee again to finalise their project.
On 19 March, their collaboration was publicly announced. Tentatively titled as VD18, instead of directing it, Atlee was revealed to produce the project under his house A for Apple Productions, along with Murad Khetani's Cine1 Studios and Jyoti Deshpande's Jio Studios. Kalees, who had earlier assisted Atlee and directed the Tamil techno-thriller film Kee (2019), was hired to helm the project. The official title Baby John was announced on 5 February 2024. In an interview with Trisha Bhattacharya of India Today, Dhawan stated: "When Atlee came with this film, there was a reason behind it, and he said that we had to change a lot of the geography of the film. We have to use it as an adaptation and not really a proper remake, and I think that's what's done." He also added that the film, highlighted real-life incidents about women's safety in India and a contemporary take on parenting.

=== Critical response ===
Baby John received mixed-to-negative reviews from critics and audiences, with criticism for its sluggish pacing, unoriginal plot, and lack of suspense. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 33% of 12 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 3.9/10. 
Aman Wadhwa of DNA India gave 3.5/5 stars and wrote "Baby John is the perfect masala entertainer that the Bollywood needed to round off a rather disappointing year". Chirag Sehgal of News 18 gave 3/5 stars and wrote "While Baby John boasts commendable performances, it falls short of being a compelling thriller due to its lackluster plot and uneven pacing." Anam Shaikh of Spottoday gave 3/5 stars and wrote "A Mass Entertainer with Heart and Action".
Sana Farzeen of India Today gave 3/5 stars and wrote "Baby John could either benefit from the withdrawal symptoms fans are experiencing after Pushpa 2: The Rule or lose the battle to Allu Arjun's mass-actioner. Lachmi Deb Roy of Firstpost gave 3/5 stars and wrote "Varun Dhawan has done a good job as an action hero, the show stellar is undoubtedly Jackie Shroff, but Wamiqa Gabbi is hugely underused in the film". Rishil Jogani of Pinkvilla gave 2.5/5 stars and wrote "Baby John attempts to tackle a serious social issue but falls short due to its superficial treatment and over-reliance on overused narrative tropes. While the action sequences and background score are commendable, the film fails to provide a nuanced or innovative take on its subject matter." Dhaval Roy of Times of India gave 2.5/5 stars and wrote "Varun Dhawan impresses, balancing a dual role as a caring father and a fearless cop. His performance adds depth and conviction to the otherwise predictable narrative.[...] The movie has its moments as an actioner, but in terms of content and narrative, it could have more impactful."
Tanmayi Savadi of Times Now gave 2.5/5 stars and wrote "Baby John is a good attempt at fan service. But, offers nothing fresh and exciting. It is high time to redefine mass actioners that come from South filmmakers." Kartik Bhardwaj of Cinema Express gave 2/5 stars and wrote "Baby John feels like a feverishly hurried version of Theri. It doesnâ€™t let the characters marinate and is too eager to get to the conflict. The build-up is often half-baked, and the action, when it comes, is underwhelming." Aishwarya Vasudevan of OTT Play gave 2/5 stars and wrote "Baby John tries to rock the cradle of Bollywood with South Indian masala but ends up crying over spilt milk."
Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV gave 2/5 stars and wrote "Trouble is that Baby John falls way, way short of working action movie fans up into a celebratory frenzy." Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express gave 1/5 stars and wrote "Baby John bids fair to claim the title of the worst film of 2024, a year when big, starry Bollywood tanked well and truly." Rishabh Suri of Hindustan Times wrote "Overall, thereâ€™s nothing much that makes Baby John stand out apart from the action. Itâ€™s watchable if you can sit through the boring songs, and the atrocious first half hour."
Bollywood Hungama gave 3.5/5 stars and wrote "Baby John is a mass entertainer which works due to the clapworthy moments, the message, Varun Dhawanâ€™s energetic performance and the cameo by Salman Khan. At the box office, the film will benefit owing to the long holiday period and no competition until Republic Day."


=== Box office ===
Baby John is estimated to have collected â‚¹11.25 to â‚¹13.5 crore nett on its opening day at the domestic box office. As of 2 January 2025, the film has grossed â‚¹39.74 crore in India and â‚¹13.66 crore internationally, bringing its total worldwide gross to â‚¹53.4 crore.
