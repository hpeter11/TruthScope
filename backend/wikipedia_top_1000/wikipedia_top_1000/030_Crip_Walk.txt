The Crip Walk, also known as the C-Walk, is a dance move that was created in the 1970s by first generation Crip member Robert "Sugar Bear" Jackson , and has since spread worldwide.


== Overview ==
The dance is primarily an act of performing quick and intricate footwork.
The rivalry between the Crips and the Bloods spilled over into the world of entertainment, with the adoption of the gang dance by various rappers on the West Coast of the United States, who gave it its name, the Crip Walk. This dance involves the movement of one's feet, classically to the spelling of C-R-I-P. It was used by Crips at parties to display affiliation, particularly vis-a-vis rival gang the Bloods. It was also used after killing someone to give the kill a Crip signature. MTV declined to broadcast any music videos that contained the Crip Walk.
