The Floor is an American game show based on the Dutch game show of the same name. The series is hosted by Rob Lowe and premiered on January 2, 2024, on Fox. Standing in separate squares of a floor grid, contestants with expertise in a variety of trivia subjects challenge each other in head-to-head duels, with the winner of each duel taking over all territory controlled by the loser.


== Format ==
Each season begins with a large number of contestants (81 in Season 1 and 100 since Season 2) standing in separate spaces of a grid (nine-by-nine in Season 1 and ten-by-ten since Season 2) on the studio floor. Each contestant has a category in which they feel particularly knowledgeable. However, the producers of the show ultimately decide the categories the contestants have.
The game progresses over the course of a season with the grand prize awarded to the player who ultimately controls the entire floor. Secondary prizes are awarded throughout the season to the player with the most territory at the end of each episode.
One contestant is chosen at random and shown the categories of all opponents whose territories share at least one edge with their own, then chooses one of them to face in a head-to-head duel. The two contestants take turns identifying a series of images or words associated with the challenged opponent's category. They are given separate 45-second clocks, only one of which runs at any given time, starting with the challenger. The contestant in control must give a correct answer in order to stop their clock and turn control over to the opponent. Multiple guesses are allowed without penalty, and a contestant may pass whenever desired; however, they must wait three seconds for a new image or text to be shown. Some categories are text-based, requiring contestants to perform tasks such as filling in the missing word(s) of a book title or song lyric, or naming the movie from which a famous quote is taken. Beginning in season two, audio duels are introduced, requiring contestants to decipher answers via audio cue and providing visuals as hints.
The first contestant to run out of time is eliminated from the game and gives up all of their territory to the winner, who inherits the challenger's category. The winner may then either challenge another opponent or return to the grid; in the latter case, a new contestant is selected at random from those who have not yet played a duel. If all contestants have played a duel, everyone becomes eligible for the selection. When only two contestants remain, the one controlling more territory decides which category is played. Starting with season 2, the final duel is played to a maximum of three rounds, and the first contestant to win two rounds is declared the champion. Each category is used for only one round, with the contestant in control deciding which one will be played first; if a third round is required, a mystery category is used for it.
At the end of each episode, apart from the final night (episodes 9 & 10 in season 1), the contestant holding the most territory wins $20,000. In the event of a tie, the leaders share the money equally. The last contestant standing at the end of the final episode of the season (episode 10 in season 1) takes over the entire floor and wins the grand prize of $250,000.
Beginning with season 2, any contestant who wins three consecutive duels after choosing to play on is granted a five-second "Time Boost", which they may add to their own clock at the start of any future duel except the best-of-three final. A contestant may not earn another time boost until the first one has been used.
