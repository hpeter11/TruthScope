He finished this game against the Miami Dolphins with three field goals made in three attempts, which made him 90-for-101 in his career, for a career field goal percentage of 89.109%, which gave him the second best percentage in NFL history, trailing only Baltimore's Justin Tucker, who at that time had converted 260 field goals in 287 attempts in his career for a percentage of 90.592%.

In his first game back from the injury against the Bills, Butker broke the Chiefs' franchise record for longest field goal for the second time (his previous record of 58 had been broken while he was injured) with a 62-yard field goal. It was the 15th field goal in NFL history 62 yards or longer. In his first five games after returning from injury, Butker missed an extra point or a field goal in each of those games, the longest such streak of his career. Butker ended the streak making all three field goal attempts and all three extra point attempts in Week 11 against the Chargers. Due to the injury, with the missed time and the injury causing kicking issues, Butker had what was statistically the worst season of his career. Butker had a career low field goal percentage (75%), a career high in misses (6), and a career low in attempts (24). In the AFC Championship Game, Butker hit a 45-yard game winning field goal to defeat the Cincinnati Bengals 23–20 to send the Chiefs to Super Bowl LVII.

During a Week 17 25–17 victory over the Cincinnati Bengals, Butker went 6-for-6 on field goals and was named AFC Special Teams Player of the Week for his performance. His six field goals made set a career high. Butker finished the season making 33-of-35 attempts, tying a career low for missed field goals and setting a career high in field goal percentage with 94.3%. Butker made all 12 of his attempts from over 40 yards, including his second successful field goal from over 60 yards. Butker did not miss a single extra point attempt for the second time in his career. Butker's performance in the 2023 season moved him back into second place in NFL history in career field goal percentage (minimum 100 attempts).
In Super Bowl LVIII, Butker broke two Super Bowl records: longest made field goal in Super Bowl history (57) and most career field goals in the Super Bowl (9). The Chiefs won in overtime 25–22. The win gave Butker his third Super Bowl victory and his second consecutive win. The win made Butker the fourth kicker in NFL history with three Super Bowl wins.


==== 2024 season ====
On August 5, 2024, the Chiefs re-signed Butker to a four-year, $25.6 million extension. On November 14, 2024, Butker suffered a knee injury during practice and was placed on injured reserve on November 15, 2024.  While on injured reserve, Butker moved from 3rd to 1st place in all-time field goal percentage. At the time of his injury, Butker had made 215 of 241 field goal attempts for a percentage of 89.212%. He was third behind Carolina's Eddy Piñeiro (89.744%) and Baltimore's Justin Tucker (89.371%).  On December 1, 2024, Piñeiro went 3-for-5 in Carolina's game against Tampa Bay to fall to 88.525% and from 1st to 3rd, while Tucker also fell behind Butker, going 2-for-4 in Baltimore's game against Philadelphia, falling to 89.032%, but remaining in second behind Butker and ahead of Piñeiro. On December 14, 2024, he was activated from injured reserve. Butker held the top spot for two weeks and when he returned from injury against the Browns on December 15, 2024, he went 0-for-1 in field goal attempts, and his percentage fell to 88.843%, falling behind Tucker, who attempted no field goals in his December 15, 2024, game at the Giants and remained at 89.032%.

=== Views ===


==== Religious beliefs ====
Butker is a devout Traditionalist Catholic. Butker has publicly spoken out against Traditionis custodes, saying that he felt that he and other traditionalist Catholics were "persecuted" in the Church.


==== Allegations of antisemitism ====
In May 2024, Butker gave a commencement address at Benedictine College. The speech was met by applause and a standing ovation from the audience. Among other topics, he criticized a provision of a bill condemning antisemitism as overly broad. Butker said, "We fear speaking truth, because now, unfortunately, truth is in the minority. Congress just passed a bill where stating something as basic as the biblical teaching of who killed Jesus could land you in jail".
Dave Zirin of The Nation condemned Butker's comments as antisemitic. Yvette Walker of the Kansas City Star also criticized Butker's speech: "The church long has held that Jews could not be held collectively accountable, since the Second Vatican Council in the 1960s. In 2011, Pope Benedict XVI affirmed this...and wrote there is no basis in Scripture for blaming Jews."


==== Comments about women in the workforce ====
Butker was the commencement speaker at his alma mater, Georgia Tech, in 2023. He received widespread attention for his exhortation to "get married and start a family."
During Butker's 2024 address at Benedictine College, he said:

I think it is you, the women, who have had the most diabolical lies told to you. How many of you are sitting here now about to cross this stage and are thinking about all the promotions and titles you are going to get in your career? Some of you may go on to lead successful careers in the world, but I would venture to guess that the majority of you are most excited about your marriage and the children you will bring into this world...I'm on the stage today and able to be the man I am because I have a wife who leans into her vocation...and embrace one of the most important titles of all: homemaker. I can tell you that my beautiful wife Isabelle would be the first to say that her life truly started when she started living her vocation as a wife and as a mother.
Several articles highlighted that Butker's mother, Elizabeth Keller Butker, has been a clinical medical physicist at Emory University and holds two university degrees. His speech, which included other personal and political opinions, was met with controversy. On May 15, 2024, in response to Butker's comments and the ensuant backlash, NFL senior vice president and chief diversity and inclusion officer Jonathan Beane told People in a written statement: "His views are not those of the NFL as an organization. The NFL is steadfast in our commitment to inclusion, which only makes our league stronger." Outsports wrote, "One of the worst parts of this NFL player's awful speech is that he quoted a Taylor Swift song before telling women they should be homemakers and serve their man's career." On his New Heights podcast, Travis Kelce said he did not agree with "just about any" of Butker's views but did "cherish" him as a teammate.
Others were supportive of Butker's remarks. Hunter Estes, communications director for Mississippi governor Tate Reeves, tweeted a portion of Butker's message, "Be unapologetic in your masculinity. Fight against the cultural emasculation of men. Do hard things. Never settle for what is easy", and added, "This is indeed a brave and rebellious message for our current age. The world needs more good men like Harrison Butker." Tavia Hunt, the director of the Kansas City Chiefs Women's Organization and wife of Chiefs CEO Clark Hunt, wrote on Instagram, "Affirming motherhood and praising your wife, as well as highlighting the sacrifice and dedication it takes to be a mother, is not bigoted. It is empowering to acknowledge that a woman's hard work in raising children is not in vain."


==== Anti-abortion advocacy ====
Butker supported the 2022 Kansas Value Them Both Amendment, which would have overridden a 2019 Kansas Supreme Court ruling that the Kansas constitution guarantees the right to abortion. In 2023, Butker wore an anti-abortion tie while attending the Chiefs' Super Bowl LVII victory celebration at The White House in protest of President Joe Biden's pro-choice views.


==== Anti-LGBTQ beliefs ====
In a March 2024 interview with the Catholic News Agency, Butker condemned the Catholic Church for burying the recently deceased transgender rights advocate Cecilia Gentili. In his 2024 commencement speech to Benedictine College, while advocating for a more conservative form of Catholicism, he called Pride Month an example of the "deadly sins". Former Kansas City commissioner Justice Horn criticized Butker, writing that he "doesn't represent Kansas City nor has he ever. Kansas City has always been a place that welcomes, affirms and embraces our LGBTQ+ community members."


==== Political beliefs ====
Butker's 2024 address to the graduating class of Benedictine College covered a number of his political beliefs. In the speech, Butker condemned President Biden's stance on abortion. He also attacked Biden's response to the COVID-19 pandemic, IVF, surrogacy, the LGBTQ community and Pride Month, women in the workforce, diversity, equity, and inclusion, and a bill condemning antisemitism.
On October 11, 2024, Butker endorsed former president Donald Trump for the 2024 United States presidential election. He cited Trump's anti-abortion record as his reason for endorsing him.
