Josh Sweat (born March 29, 1997) is an American professional football linebacker for the Philadelphia Eagles of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football at Florida State.


== Early life ==
A native of Chesapeake, Virginia, Sweat attended Oscar F. Smith High School where he was teammates with Andrew Brown. In his junior year, he recorded 94 tackles and helped Oscar Smith to march undefeated into the 2013 VHSL 6A state championship game, where they were upset by Centreville High School 35–6. In off-season football camps, Sweat impressed with his athleticism and triggered comparisons to Jadeveon Clowney.
Starting his senior year as the top-rated prospect in the country by ESPN, Sweat registered 25 tackles, 11 tackles for loss, and eight sacks in the first two games of the season. During the third game of the season, against Western Branch High School, Sweat suffered a season-ending injury as he dislocated his knee and tore his ACL. He underwent reconstructive surgery in New York performed by New York Giants team physician Russell Warren, before graduating from Oscar Smith in December 2014 to enroll early in college.
Initially being regarded the top prospect of his class, Sweat fell in the rankings after his injury. He dropped to No. 11 in ESPN's final ranking of the class of 2015, but retained his five-star status. Sweat committed to Florida State over offers from Virginia Tech, Georgia, Ohio State, and Oregon.
