=== Early life ===
Roberts was born in Manhattan, New York City, the son of radio announcer Ken Roberts and Norma (née Finkelstein), an animator. His family was Jewish. Roberts attended the High School of Music & Art and Northwestern University, and he made his Broadway debut in 1962 with a role in the play Something About a Soldier.


=== Film ===
Roberts collaborated with Woody Allen. In Annie Hall, he portrayed Alvy Singer's best friend Rob. Other Allen movies and plays in which he appeared include both the Broadway and movie versions of Play It Again, Sam; he appeared, too, in Stardust Memories (1980), A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy (1982), Hannah and Her Sisters (1986) and Radio Days (1987). In 2001, Roberts also made an appearance in Allen's respective segment for The Concert for New York City.
Roberts portrayed Deputy Mayor Warren LaSalle in The Taking of Pelham One Two Three. He also appeared in the Sidney Lumet movies Serpico and Just Tell Me What You Want. In a rare, big-screen leading role, Roberts starred in the 1983 horror movie Amityville 3-D, playing John Baxter, a deeply skeptical, Doubting Thomas-type tabloid journalist who buys the infamous and possessed haunted house. He appeared opposite George Burns (as his son) in 1988's Eighteen Again!, and co-starred in the horror-dark comedy Popcorn, as Professor Davis, and in Blake Edwards' situation comedy Switch, as Arnold Freidkin, both 1991 theatrical releases. Roberts also enjoyed screentime in the Walt Disney screwball comedy The Million Dollar Duck and the stage-to-screen adaptation of Star Spangled Girl, both 1971 (and both co-starring Sandy Duncan), Key Exchange and Le Sauvage, both 1985, 1986's Seize the Day, and 2005's Twelve and Holding, among others.
Roberts' last theatrically-released feature film role was as Jason Bateman's character's therapist in the 2014 independent romantic comedy-drama The Longest Week, while his final made-for-television film portrayal was in the 2017 ABC production Dirty Dancing.
