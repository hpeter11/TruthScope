Super Bowl LXI is the planned American football championship game of the National Football League (NFL) for the 2026 season. The game is scheduled to be played on February 14, 2027, at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California. This would be the ninth Super Bowl hosted by the Greater Los Angeles area, and the second at this venue, the first being Super Bowl LVI in 2022.
The game is planned to be nationally televised by ESPN and ABC marking the first Super Bowl simulcast between the two sister networks, the first time ABC has aired the Super Bowl since Super Bowl XL in 2006, and the first time that ESPN has ever aired the Super Bowl.


== Background ==


=== Host selection ===
The league has made all decisions regarding hosting sites from Super Bowl LVII (held in February 2023) onward. There is no bidding process per site: the league selects a potential venue unilaterally, the chosen team puts together a hosting proposal, and then the league votes to determine whether it is acceptable.   
On December 13, 2023, the NFL announced that SoFi Stadium, home of both the Los Angeles Rams and the Los Angeles Chargers, was selected as the Super Bowl site.

==== Television ====
Super Bowl LXI will be televised nationally by ESPN and simulcast on ABC as part of the 11-year NFL television contract, which allows a four-year rotation between CBS, Fox, NBC and ABC/ESPN. This would mark the first time ABC has aired the Super Bowl since Super Bowl XL, and the first time ever that ESPN has aired the Super Bowl. When ESPN took over the Monday Night Football package from ABC in 2006, the NFL was reluctant to give ESPN any broadcasting rights to the Super Bowl or any playoff games. ESPN was then given the rights to air a first-round Wild Card playoff game on the channel after the conclusion of the 2014 season. The cable-only playoff game experiment only lasted one season, and ABC started simulcasting all of ESPN's playoff games beginning in the 2015 season. But the NFL refrained from having an ABC/ESPN simulcast of the Super Bowl until Super Bowl LXI.
It is expected that the alternative Manningcast will be on ESPN2, and a Spanish-language feed of the game on ESPN Deportes.

The game is planned to be streamed live on ESPN+, as well as NFL+ via mobile devices.
