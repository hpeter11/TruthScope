== Non-occurrences ==
In the history of the Super Bowl, the following firsts have yet to occur:

Snow - Super Bowl XLI was the first to feature rain, but snow has yet to fall during a Super Bowl, mainly because the league has purposely placed the game in venues where snow is rare. Only once, Super Bowl XLVIII, has the league awarded the Super Bowl to an outdoor venue where snow is a common occurrence in late January and early February, and that particular game was warmer than usual for that time of year.
An all-wild card matchup (teams who failed to win their divisions) – Eleven wild card teams have won conference titles since the AFL–NFL merger, but never two in the same season. The closest the NFL has come to having an all-wild card Super Bowl occurred during the 2010–11 NFL playoffs when the New York Jets, a wild card team, reached the AFC Championship Game where they played the Pittsburgh Steelers. The Steelers beat the Jets 24–19. In the subsequent Super Bowl, the Steelers faced another wild card team, the Green Bay Packers, who beat them 31–25.
A punt return for touchdown - Many kickoffs have been returned for touchdowns, and three blocked punts have been returned for a touchdown.
A shutout – Every Super Bowl participant to date has scored. In seven cases, the offenses have failed to score a touchdown. In four of those cases, the special teams scored the only touchdown:
Super Bowl VI: The Miami Dolphins finished with three points, tied for the fewest points by a single team in a Super Bowl to date (and making them one of three teams to date to fail to score a touchdown).
Super Bowl VII: The Washington Redskins, after blocking a field goal attempt, returned a fumble on an attempted pass by the Miami Dolphins kicker, Garo Yepremian, for a touchdown and converted the extra point with 2:07 remaining in the game.
Super Bowl IX: The Minnesota Vikings recovered a blocked punt in the end zone but did not convert the extra point with 10:33 left in the game.
Super Bowl XXIII: The Cincinnati Bengals scored on a 93-yard kickoff return with extra point in the third quarter and kicked three field goals throughout the game.
Super Bowl XXXV: The New York Giants scored on a 97-yard kickoff return and converted the extra point in the third quarter.
Super Bowl LIII: The Los Angeles Rams scored only three points on a field goal versus the New England Patriots (tying the Miami Dolphins’ record for fewest points in a game originally set in Super Bowl VI).
Super Bowl LV: The Kansas City Chiefs scored three field goals but no touchdowns.
Two teams from the same metropolitan area - Two cities currently have two franchises: New York hosts both the Giants and the Jets, and Los Angeles hosts both the Chargers and the Rams. In addition, the Baltimore Ravens and the Washington Commanders share a common metropolitan area, although they are based in different cities. All of the teams mentioned above except for the Chargers have won a Super Bowl, but never against their neighbor.
Super Bowl XLI between the Indianapolis Colts and Chicago Bears represents the geographically closest teams, separated by only 164 miles (264 km).
One game involved teams from the same state: Super Bowl XXIX involved the San Francisco 49ers and the San Diego Chargers. Super Bowl XXV involved the Buffalo Bills of New York and the New York Giants, who also historically and nominally represented the state but were by this point based in New Jersey.
An appearance by every team – Four teams have yet to reach their first Super Bowl: the Cleveland Browns, Detroit Lions, Houston Texans and Jacksonville Jaguars. The Lions and Browns both won NFL championships in the pre-Super Bowl era, most recently in 1957 and 1964, respectively. The Jaguars and Texans are post-merger expansion teams that began play in 1995 and 2002, respectively.
Every team winning – 12 teams have yet to win their first Super Bowl: the Arizona Cardinals, Atlanta Falcons, Buffalo Bills, Carolina Panthers, Cincinnati Bengals, Los Angeles Chargers, Minnesota Vikings, and Tennessee Titans, along with the four that have not appeared in a Super Bowl. The Chargers, the Titans (known as the Houston Oilers from 1960 to 1996), and the Bills all won American Football League (AFL) championships in the pre-Super Bowl era. The Cardinals, Browns and the Lions have won NFL championships in the pre-Super Bowl era. The Vikings won the 1969 NFL Championship Game, the last NFL Championship Game before the AFL–NFL merger, but lost Super Bowl IV to the AFL champions, the Kansas City Chiefs. Since the merger, the Vikings have appeared in the Super Bowl three more times (Super Bowl VIII, Super Bowl IX, and most recently in Super Bowl XI) but lost all three of them. Thus the Jaguars, Texans, Bengals, Falcons, and Panthers have yet to win their first league championship.
Every team losing – The Baltimore Ravens, New Orleans Saints, New York Jets, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and the four teams that have never reached a Super Bowl have yet to lose a Super Bowl.
No touchdowns scored – In every Super Bowl to date, there has been at least one touchdown scored (Fewest combined – 1, in Super Bowl LIII).
A three-peat. Two teams (the New England Patriots and the Dallas Cowboys) won three Super Bowl titles in four years and the Pittsburgh Steelers won 4 Super Bowl titles in 6 years, which included back to back championships twice.  New England did the same from 2016–2018, winning the first and the last Super Bowls of three appearances. The Green Bay Packers were the 1965 NFL Champions and won the first two Super Bowls following their victories in the 1966 and 1967 NFL Championship Games. The Buffalo Bills appeared in four consecutive Super Bowls, but lost every time.  The Miami Dolphins appeared in three consecutive Super Bowls from 1971–1973, winning the final two. The 2024 Chiefs had the closest attempt at a three-peat in their third consecutive Super Bowl in Super Bowl LIX, after winning the previous two, but was not able to convert the third game into a win.
Fair catch kick – A fair catch kick has never been attempted in the Super Bowl. The only scenario in which a fair catch kick was seriously considered was at the end of regulation in Super Bowl LI, when New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick considered a 75-yard fair catch kick attempt.  Belichick decided against it, however, since the kick would not have had a realistic chance of success and could have been returned by the Atlanta Falcons for a game-winning touchdown.
A head coach leading two different teams to Super Bowl victories. Five Super Bowl-winning coaches also coached another team but lost: Don Shula, Bill Parcells, Mike Holmgren, Dick Vermeil and Andy Reid.
