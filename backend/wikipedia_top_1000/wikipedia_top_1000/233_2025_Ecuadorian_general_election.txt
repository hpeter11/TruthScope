General elections were held in Ecuador on 9 February 2025. Incumbent president Daniel Noboa is running for re-election following his victory in the 2023 general election. He will face leftist Luisa González. The election will also elect members of the National Assembly to a full four-year term.
Incumbent president Daniel Noboa narrowly placed ahead of leftist challenger Luisa González in the first round. As no candidate won a majority in the presidential election, a runoff will be held on 13 April 2025.


== Background ==
The 2025 Ecuadorian general election follows an early election held in 2023 after then-president Guillermo Lasso invoked the muerte cruzada. That constitutional mechanism dissolved the National Assembly and triggered a snap election. In that election, Daniel Noboa was elected to complete Lasso’s unfinished term, which runs until May 2025.
As Noboa’s mandate was only for the remainder of Lasso’s term, Ecuador is now returning to its regular electoral schedule. The 2025 election will determine the president and vice president for a full four-year term and members of the National Assembly.
In May 2024, Noboa formally registered his candidacy for re-election with the National Electoral Council.


=== Political and security context ===
In 2024, Ecuador faced a major security crisis when José Adolfo Macías Villamar, leader of the criminal group Los Choneros, escaped from prison in Guayaquil on the day he was scheduled to be transferred to a maximum-security facility. Authorities reported the escape the following day and filed charges against two prison officers. In response, President Noboa declared a 60-day state of emergency. Riots erupted in multiple prisons after Noboa authorized military intervention in penitentiaries. Two days later, coordinated armed attacks took place across the country, including armed groups storming a television station during a live broadcast.


== Electoral system ==
The president is elected using a modified two-round system: a candidate who receives over 50% of the vote, or over 40% of the vote with a 10-point advantage over their nearest rival, is elected in the first round. The president is limited to two consecutive four-year terms. However, Noboa is currently serving the remaining term of Guillermo Lasso, whose invoking of muerte cruzada resulted in the calling of the 2023 snap general election and the early conclusion of his presidency.
Members of the National Assembly are elected by three methods. Fifteen are elected by closed-list proportional representation in a nationwide constituency. Six are elected by overseas voters (two each from Canada/the United States, Latin America/the Caribbean/Africa, and Europe/Oceania/Asia). The remaining 116 members are elected from multi-member constituencies by closed-list proportional representation, with all seats allocated using the Webster method. Members of the National Assembly are limited to two four-year terms, whether consecutive or not. There are gender quotas for the party lists, meaning there is alternation between men and women. There are no quotas for minority representation.

== Conduct ==
A three-day ban on alcohol was imposed beginning on 7 February, with 20 people subsequently being arrested for violating it. On election day, the government deployed soldiers to secure polling booths while the country's land borders were closed. In Guayaquil, one person died inside a voting center after suffering a heart attack before he could vote.


== Results ==
With 96.23% of ballots counted, preliminary results in the first round showed no candidate in the presidential election had won an outright majority, with Daniel Noboa receiving 44.15% of the vote, followed by Luisa González at 43.95%. Turnout was estimated at around 83%.
After the results, ADN canceled a planned party celebration in a hotel in northern Quito, and Noboa did not give public declarations. The next day, he posted a written statement on X thanking his voters. González, in a party meeting in Quito, said she will have dialogues with the other candidates.
As of 11 February, only four candidates (Noboa, González, Iza, and González Nader) concentrated over 96% of the votes, with the other twelve getting less than 1% of the vote. Ivan Saquicela's 0.12% (11,590 votes) is the worst-performing candidate since Carlos Sagnay in the 2006 presidential election.
