How to Train Your Dragon is an upcoming American fantasy film written, co-produced, and directed by Dean DeBlois. It is a live-action remake of DreamWorks Animation's 2010 animated film of the same name, which itself was loosely based on the 2003 novel by Cressida Cowell. The film stars Mason Thames, Nico Parker, Nick Frost, Julian Dennison, Gabriel Howell, Bronwyn James, Harry Trevaldwyn, Ruth Codd, Peter Serafinowicz, and Murray McArthur, with Gerard Butler reprising his role as Stoick the Vast from the animated films. It is the first live-action production from DreamWorks Animation, as well as its first production to be a remake.
Plans for a live-action remake of How to Train Your Dragon were announced in February 2023, with DeBlois returning to write, direct, and produce after having previously worked on the animated film trilogy, while John Powell, who also worked on the original trilogy, additionally returned to compose the score for the film. Thames and Parker joined the cast by May 2023, with additional casting revealed in January 2024. Filming began later that month in Belfast, Northern Ireland and wrapped in May.
Produced by DreamWorks Animation and Marc Platt Productions, How to Train Your Dragon is set to be released theatrically by Universal Pictures in the United States on June 13, 2025.

=== Development ===
In February 2023, it was reported that a live-action adaptation of DreamWorks Animation's 2010 How to Train Your Dragon film, which was loosely based on Cressida Cowell's eponymous book series, was in development at Universal Pictures, with Dean DeBlois directing, writing, and producing the film after previously writing and directing the animated entries, and Marc Platt and Adam Siegel joining as co-producers.

In May 2023, it was announced that Mason Thames and Nico Parker had been cast to star as Hiccup and Astrid respectively. In January 2024, Gerard Butler was cast to reprise his role as Stoick from the animated films, with Nick Frost, Julian Dennison, Gabriel Howell, Bronwyn James, and Harry Trevaldwyn joining the cast later that same month, who were cast to play Gobber, Fishlegs, Snotlout, Ruffnut and Tuffnut, respectively. In March, Ruth Codd joined the cast of the film, portraying Phlegma.

Principal photography was originally scheduled to begin in July 2023 in Belfast, Northern Ireland, before it was postponed due to the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike.

Bill Pope served as the cinematographer. Production was done with heavy use of practical sets and was filmed with the IMAX format in mind. Many scenes from the original film were re-created shot-for-shot in live-action form, notably Hiccup's first encounter with Toothless.


=== Post-production ===
Framestore will provide the film's visual effects, with Christian Manz serving as the production VFX supervisor.


== Release ==
How to Train Your Dragon is scheduled to be released by Universal Pictures on June 13, 2025, including engagements in RealD 3D and IMAX. It was previously set for release on March 14, 2025, but due to the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike, it was delayed to its current release date.
