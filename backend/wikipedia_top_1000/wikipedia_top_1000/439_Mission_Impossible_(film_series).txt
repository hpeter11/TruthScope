Mission: Impossible is a series of American action spy films, based on the 1966 TV series created by Bruce Geller. The series is mainly produced by Tom Cruise, who plays Ethan Hunt, an agent of the Impossible Mission Force (IMF). The films have been directed, written, and scored by various filmmakers and crew, while incorporating musical themes from the original series by Lalo Schifrin.
Starting in 1996, the films (taking place starting six years after the events of the previous TV sequel series) follow the missions of the IMF's main field team, under Hunt's leadership, to stop an enemy force and prevent an impending global disaster. The series focuses on Hunt's character, and like the television series' structure, is complemented by an ensemble cast, such as Luther Stickell (played by Ving Rhames) and Benji Dunn (played by Simon Pegg), who have recurring roles.
The series has experienced a generally positive reception from critics. It is the 17th-highest-grossing film series of all time, earning over $4.09 billion worldwide, and is often cited as one of the best action franchises to date. The sixth film, subtitled Fallout, was released on July 27, 2018 and is currently the series' highest-grossing entry. The seventh and most recent film, Dead Reckoning Part One, was released in July 2023, and an eighth film, The Final Reckoning, is scheduled for release in May 2025. The films are co-produced and released by Paramount Pictures.
In 2024, the series received its first Academy Award nominations, with Dead Reckoning Part One being nominated in the categories of Best Visual Effects and Best Sound at the 96th ceremony.

=== Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning (2025) ===

In January 2019, an eighth Mission: Impossible film was announced to be in development, written and directed by Christopher McQuarrie. It was originally to be filmed back-to-back with the seventh film. It was scheduled to be released on August 5, 2022, but was delayed to November 4, 2022, then to July 7, 2023, then to June 28, 2024, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It was later delayed to May 23, 2025 due to the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike.
Hayley Atwell joined the cast in September 2019, followed by Pom Klementieff and Shea Whigham. In January 2020, Nicholas Hoult and Simon Pegg were announced to be appearing in the film, but Hoult was later replaced by Esai Morales in both films due to scheduling conflicts.
In February 2020, it was announced that Henry Czerny and Vanessa Kirby would return as Eugene Kittridge and Alanna Mitsopolis, respectively. In February 2021, Deadline Hollywood reported that Part Two would no longer be filmed back-to-back with Part One. Filming of Part Two began shortly after production wrapped on Part One. It was initially billed that both films would be a send-off for Ethan Hunt. In October 2023, Dead Reckoning Part Two was removed as the film's subtitle, and in November 2024, the new subtitle The Final Reckoning was announced.


=== Future ===
In June 2023, Christopher McQuarrie stated that Dead Reckoning Part One and The Final Reckoning would not end the series, as there are developments for future installments. In July 2023, during promotion for Dead Reckoning Part One, Cruise expressed interest in continuing to make further films in the series as Ethan Hunt, despite both films having previously been billed as a send-off to the character. Inspired by Harrison Ford's continued success in the Indiana Jones films, Cruise stated that he would like to keep making Mission: Impossible films until he is likewise in his eighties.

=== Critical and public response ===
The Mission: Impossible film series has received positive reviews from critics and audiences, with the latter four attracting significant praise directed towards their direction, cinematography, stunts, action sequences, performances, and musical scores.


== Music ==

The television version is in a rarely used 54 time (an unusual time signature with five crotchets to a bar) and is difficult to dance to, as was demonstrated by a memorable segment of American Bandstand in which teenage dancers were caught off-guard by Dick Clark's playing of the Lalo Schifrin single release.
The opening theme music for the first seven films are stylized renditions of Schifrin's original iconic theme, preserving the 54 rhythm, by Danny Elfman, Hans Zimmer, Michael Giacchino, Joe Kraemer and Lorne Balfe, respectively.
For Adam Clayton and Larry Mullen Jr.'s version featured on the first film's motion picture soundtrack, the time signature was changed to standard pop 44 time to make it more dance-friendly, although the intro is still in 54 time. The Limp Bizkit song "Take a Look Around" from the soundtrack to the second film was set to a similar 44 modification of the theme, with an interlude in 54.
