Two days after her birth, Time dubbed Carter "the most famous baby in the world."

She has been the subject of depictions in media, including impersonations on Saturday Night Live and RuPaul's Drag Race.
Her 2019 single, "Brown Skin Girl" (with Beyoncé, Wizkid and Saint Jhn), entered the Billboard Hot 100 and won Best Music Video at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards. This earned her second Guinness World Record for being the youngest individually credited Grammy Award recipient, and second youngest overall. The song also won an NAACP Image Award and a BET Her Award (making her the youngest BET Award recipient). Carter made her feature film debut in 2024 in Mufasa: The Lion King, as a voice actress portraying Princess Kiara.

She finished the performance by unbuttoning her blazer and rubbing her stomach to confirm the pregnancy. Blue Ivy Carter was born on January 7, 2012, to Beyoncé and Jay-Z at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan, New York City. CBS wrote Carter was "arguably the world's most famous baby, aside from Prince George and North West". Two days after her birth, Time dubbed Carter "the most famous baby in the world."
Since her birth, her parents have "worked to secure trademarks of their daughter's name for everything, including books, shampoos, video games, and more." Beyoncé argued Carter is a "cultural icon" during the trademark process. Through her mother, Carter is a granddaughter of Tina and Mathew Knowles, a first cousin once removed of Angela Beyincé, and a niece of singer Solange Knowles.
