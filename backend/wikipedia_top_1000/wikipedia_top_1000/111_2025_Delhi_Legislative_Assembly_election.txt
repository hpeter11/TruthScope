The 2025 Delhi Legislative Assembly elections were held in Delhi on 5 February 2025 to elect all 70 members of the Delhi Legislative Assembly. The counting of votes and declaration of result took place on 8 February 2025.
The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won in 48 out of 70 seats, thus returning to power in the Union territory of Delhi after 27 years. The incumbent Aam Aadmi Party, which was in power for the previous ten years, lost the election, with several prominent leaders and cabinet ministers including national convener Arvind Kejriwal, Manish Sisodia, Satyendra Kumar Jain, Somnath Bharti, Saurabh Bhardwaj, Rakhi Birla, and Durgesh Pathak losing their seats. For a third straight election, the Indian National Congress did not win any seats, and 67 out of its 70 candidates had to forfeit their election deposit, although it increased its overall vote share compared to the last election.


== Background ==
The previous Delhi Legislative Assembly elections were held in February 2020, resulting in the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) forming the state government. Arvind Kejriwal assumed the post of Chief Minister for a third consecutive term.


=== Arrest of Arvind Kejriwal ===

After skipping nine summons from the Enforcement Directorate (ED), Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal was arrested on 21 March 2024 by the ED after the Delhi High Court rejected his anticipatory bail in connection with the Delhi liquor policy money laundering case. This made him the first sitting chief minister of India to be arrested (all others arrested before him had resigned from their post before being arrested). The opposition alliance called it a fabricated case and "match-fixing" before the 2024 general elections by the Bharatiya Janata Party led union government. The Delhi High Court dismissed Kejriwal's petition against his arrest and all his bail requests. The Supreme Court ultimately granted him interim bail from 10 May 2024 to 1 June 2024 on account of campaigning for the elections.
Following the end of his interim bail and failure to extend it on medical grounds, Kejriwal surrendered at Tihar Jail on 2 June. He was then sent to judicial custody until 5 June 2024. A Delhi court denied the plea filed by Kejriwal seeking a seven-day interim bail and extended judicial custody until 19 June and subsequently till 3 July 2024. On 20 June 2024 Kejriwal was granted bail by the trial court on a bail bond of 100,000 INR. However, his bail was put on hold before his release as ED appealed against it in the Delhi High Court. Kejriwal was then questioned for 3 days by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and arrested on 26 June 2024 from Tihar Jail in the same case. Subsequently, he was sent to judicial custody till 12 July.
On 12 July 2024, the Supreme Court granted interim bail to Kejriwal in money laundering case related to the alleged excise policy scam. However, he remained in jail due to the CBI arrest made in the previous month. On 5 September 2024, the Supreme court reserved an order on his bail in the CBI case. The reserved order was pronounced by the SC on 13 September 2024, granting him bail and ultimately leading to his release from Tihar Jail after five months. However he served in prison for more than 5 months.
On 21 September 2024, Kejriwal resigned after being jailed on corruption charges, and Atishi Marlena was sworn in as the Chief Minister. The tenure of the 7th Delhi Assembly is set to conclude on 15 February 2025. Deputy Chief Minister of Delhi Manish Sisodia had previously resigned on 28 February 2023 due to his arrest on corruption charges. He served 17 months in jail until his release on bail on 9 August 2024. Minister Satyendra Kumar Jain also resigned due to corruption charges.

=== Local Governance & Infrastructure Issues ===
Voters in Delhi expressed deep frustration over the failure to clean the Yamuna River, a promise made by the AAP government in 2020 that remained unfulfilled. The sanitation and waste management crisis further fueled discontent, with over 90% of respondents in the Lokniti-CSDS Survey expressing dissatisfaction with the overall cleanliness of the city. Additionally, air pollution and the shortage of clean drinking water emerged as major concerns, with more than 80% of voters highlighting these as pressing issues. These factors collectively contributed to the electorate's growing disillusionment with the AAP government’s performance on environmental and civic infrastructure matters.
