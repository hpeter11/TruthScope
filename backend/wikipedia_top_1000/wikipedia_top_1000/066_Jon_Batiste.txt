Jon Batiste was born in Metairie, Louisiana, to a Catholic family. He grew up in Kenner, Louisiana. Batiste is a member of a New Orleans musical dynasty, the Batiste family, that includes Lionel Batiste of the Treme Brass Band, Milton Batiste of the Olympia Brass Band, and Russell Batiste Jr. At the age of eight, he played percussion and drums with his family's band, the Batiste Brothers Band. At the age of 11, at his mother's suggestion, he switched to piano and took classical piano lessons from local teacher Shirley Herstein every Saturday for seven years. Batiste further developed his piano skills by transcribing songs from video games such as Street Fighter Alpha, Final Fantasy VII and Sonic the Hedgehog.
At 17, Batiste released his debut album, Times in New Orleans. He attended St. Augustine High School and New Orleans Center for Creative Arts with Trombone Shorty in New Orleans and graduated in 2004.

The performance concluded with a finale he composed for choir, jazz combo and orchestral instruments. In the following years, Batiste released a number of music projects, including Social Music (2013), which spent over a month at the top of the Billboard and iTunes jazz charts; The Late Show EP (2016) with Stay Human; and a holiday album, Christmas with Jon Batiste (2016).

=== Stay Human ===

In 2005, Batiste began performing regularly in New York with his Juilliard peers, bassist Phil Kuehn and drummer Joe Saylor. He later added Eddie Barbash on alto saxophone and Ibanda Ruhumbika on tuba. Batiste named the band Stay Human, which draws its moniker from the belief that human interaction during a live musical performance can uplift humanity in the midst of the "plug in, tune out" nature of modern society. The band leads impromptu street performances, which Batiste calls "love riots". Notable artists were often seen accompanying Batiste, including Wynton Marsalis.
In 2011, Stay Human released the album MY N.Y., which was recorded in its entirety on New York City Subway trains, an idea that came to Batiste after questioning how to connect with people.
On April 22, 2017, the band played for the March for Science rally at the Washington Monument in Washington, D.C.
In 2014, Batiste and Stay Human appeared on The Colbert Report to perform the group's single, "Express Yourself", written and produced with Austin Bis.

=== Juneteenth 2020 celebration ===

In June 2020, Batiste took part in the Juneteenth celebration in Brooklyn, New York with a day of protests, marches, rallies, and vigils to "celebrate, show solidarity, and fight for equal rights and treatment of Black people.” Performing on the steps of the Brooklyn Public Library, Batiste was joined by Matt Whitaker in a performance presented in partnership with Sing For Hope.
The 2020 Juneteenth took place during the protests, following the murder of George Floyd, as well as the COVID-19 pandemic, seen by some as connected to an increase in an awareness of racial injustice. When questioned as to the differences he sees in the present movement for change and its connection to music, Batiste responded by saying: "...music has always been something that has had all of the different purposes of our life and our community and our healing and our unspoken pain – and the transmission of messages and the raising awareness of a condition of a people. [...] What's different, now, is that it's much more widespread in the support of changing the systemic oppression that's been going on for 400 years." He believes, "Now, it's more important than ever for us to be reintroduced to what our ancestors used music for, because it's been forgotten. [...] The world, at large, sees music as entertainment. It's never been that, at its root. It is that in one element of it, but the entire spectrum of music is far, far deeper and wide-ranging."


=== Soul and We Are ===
Batiste composed music for the 2020 film Soul, collaborating with Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross. The trio went on to win the Academy Award for Best Original Score and a Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score, among many other wins and nominations.
On March 19, 2021, Batiste released We Are, his fifth solo studio album. Speaking to Atwood Magazine, he described it as "a culmination of my life, to this point" and "the most representative of where I am, as a creative, and as an artist".
In July 2021, Batiste released a live EP, Live at Electric Lady, performed in one day at Electric Lady Studios. The album was released, exclusively, to Spotify.
In October 2021, he made a surprise performance at night singing "Like a Prayer" in the streets of Harlem, along with Madonna, promoting the release of her concert film , Madame X.
At the 64th Grammy Awards, Batiste earned 11 nominations: eight for We Are, and three for Soul. Of the 11 nominations, Batiste won five awards, including Album of the Year, becoming the second Black artist to win that award since 2008, when Herbie Hancock won for his album River: The Joni Letters.

=== American Symphony ===
On September 22, 2022, Batiste conducted the premiere of his composition American Symphony at Carnegie Hall, New York. A review in Variety concluded:  "It wasn't just the story of America, and its collage-like charms and vices. This was also Batiste's story, and he made a handsome orchestral debut of that story at Carnegie Hall, in a truly shining hour."
In 2023, Batiste was featured in the documentary film American Symphony, directed by Matthew Heineman, executive produced by Barack and Michelle Obama, which records the process of Batiste composing his first symphony, while his wife, Suleika Jaouad, suffers the return of her leukemia.

Batiste followed these with a number of solo shows, billed as "STREAMS: Jon Batiste At The Piano", in which Batiste improvised performances at the piano and on melodica in a stream-of-consciousness manner.

== Influences and music style ==
Batiste cites, among the artists who have most influenced his artistic and musical choices, Mahalia Jackson, James Brown, Louis Armstrong, Bruce Springsteen, Stevie Wonder, John Coltrane, Nina Simone, Miles Davis and Django Reinhardt. Interviewed by Forbes, Batiste explained the significance of jazz music:Music is a real form of connection to a higher power at its greatest; music was a form of community that brought people together and gave them a common purpose. Jazz is really a term that doesn't encompass what it's pointing at, [...] the intellectual breadth of black geniuses who were basically denied the credential of being a genius in society because of their skin tone. [...] We always talk about improvisation, and it really is one of the only forms of music that exemplifies the American experiment putting all these different cultures into one country and coexisting and trying to create beautiful music together.
About his 2024 album Beethoven Blues, Batiste told The New York Times that Beethoven's music "is so very African, filled with polyrhythms" and the "feeling" of the blues. Batiste's original compositions on the album include "Dusklight Movement", inspired both by the "Moonlight" Sonata, and a bit by B.B. King's "The Thrill Is Gone".


== Activism and philanthropy ==
Batiste was born into a family active in the struggle against racial segregation in the United States; his grandfather, David Gauthier, was president of the Louisiana Postal Workers Union, involved in the 1968 labor strike sponsored by the Memphis, Tennessee, Department of Public Works for higher wages and safer working conditions.
Batiste is a supporter of civil rights, the fight against racism, participating, publicly, in numerous demonstrations, including the marches promoted by the Black Lives Matter movement. Following the murder of George Floyd in June 2020, Batiste organized peaceful protests in New York City, against police brutality in the United States.
Through the single "We Are", he supports the Equal Justice Initiative of attorney and activist Bryan Stevenson. Batiste is also among the sponsors of several initiatives, including Innocence Project, the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, and The Legacy Museum.


== Personal life ==
Batiste is married to journalist, musician, and best-selling author Suleika Jaouad. The two met as teenagers at band camp. On April 3, 2022, the couple revealed, in an interview on CBS News Sunday Morning, that they had been married in a private ceremony at home, in February 2022.
