=== Critical response ===
Avad Mohammad of OTTplay gave 3.5/5 stars and wrote "Sankranthiki Vasthunnam is a perfect festival watch packed with loads of entertainment. Venkatesh leads from the front, delivering a hilarious performance. While the predictable storyline may not appeal to everyone, the family audience is sure to enjoy the film." T. Maruthi Acharya of India Today gave 3/5 stars and wrote "With its mix of engaging comedy and uneven storytelling, Sankranthiki Vasthunnam is a decent outing for families seeking light-hearted entertainment." B.H. Harish of Cinema Express gave 3/5 stars and wrote "But then again, it depends on you if you want to judge this film from that lens. For everyone else who merely wants to have a few hearty laughs, Sankranthiki Vasthunam offers them in plenty." Sashidhar Adivi of Times Now gave 2.5/5 stars and wrote "Sankranthiki Vasthunnam will often make you laugh, especially if you are a fan of out-and-out slapstick comedies. A focused script, tighter editing and impressive cinematography would have elevated the film a few notches. The muddled-up storyline and how the events pan out leave much to be desired."
