== Plot ==
Amar Felix, an employee at a clothing store, secretly records a woman in a changing room and blackmails her for money. He has carried out similar schemes with other women, blackmailing them or their relatives, and operates from an abandoned clothing warehouse he owns. One day, a mysterious individual enters the warehouse, kills Amar, and burns it down along with his body.
Weeks later, DYSP Dineshan is contacted by Malayali-Tamil CI Allen Jacob of the Karnataka Police, who has been assigned to investigate Amar's murder. Allen reveals he has an eyewitness, Alisha, whose identity is being protected and is called Ann for the investigation. Ann, who has a photographic memory, claims she can identify the killer. Dineshan offers them a safe house in his building, where Haran Shankar, a part-time karate instructor with OCD caused by an abusive father, lives with his sister Devika and half-sister Neerja.
During a scooter theft incident in the neighborhood, Haran demonstrates his sketching skills, learned from his late mother, a police sketch artist. Impressed, Allen asks Haran to sketch the killer based on Ann's description. Ann's first description unexpectedly matches Haran's face, raising Allen's suspicions. However, when Haran creates a second sketch at the crime scene, it produces a different face, which Ann confirms as the killer.
A lookout notice is issued, but it is revealed that Haran is, in fact, the one who killed Amar. Realizing his identity might be compromised, Haran attempts to break into Ann's house but is caught by his uncle Sudarshan, a doctor. Ann holds them at gunpoint, and Sudarshan realizes that Ann cannot recognize faces and her memory is unreliable. Allen arrives and addresses Ann as Alisha.
Four weeks earlier, Alisha Abdul Samad, a news presenter, had been informed by Nakul, a hacker, about Amar's crimes. Seeking to expose him, she secretly entered Amar's warehouse but was caught in the fire set by Haran and fled, only to be struck by a truck, leading to her developing prosopagnosia.
Allen attempts to arrest Haran, but another man, Ameer Ali, surrenders and confesses, clearing Haran's name. However, Haran later reveals to Alisha that he killed Amar after discovering that Amar had raped his sister Neerja and her friend Sakina. Haran had remained silent until Sakina's brother Ansar, blackmailed by Amar, sought his help. Furious, Haran killed Amar and Ansar's father, who turned out to be Ameer, vowed to protect Ansar.
The next day, Allen disappears. Haran realizes Allen is after Amar's hard drive, which contains incriminating videos. Allen attacks Haran and Alisha during a car chase, stealing Haran's disguise to approach Dineshan. Allen kills Dineshan to retrieve the hard drive, but Alisha mistakenly believes Haran is responsible. Two days later, Haran proves his innocence to her. Allen's backstory reveals he is a suspended officer who exploited the Witness Protection Scheme to sell new identities to criminals, including business magnate Chinappa. In one instance, he sold the identity of Chitrammal, a journalist's widow, to Chinappa, who tried to kill her. To silence Chithrammal permanently, Allen hired Amar to blackmail Ansar into facilitating her murder during a flight to Bangalore. Amar, however, abducted Neerja and Sakina for his own schemes, setting off the chain of events.
Allen holds Devika and Neerja hostage at Devika's hospital headquarters while the police question Sudarshan about Haran's past. It is revealed that Haran is actually a former NSG commando and an active Sky Marshal. Haran boards Chitrammal's flight and, with Nakul and Alisha's help, discovers that seven other witnesses are onboard whose identities Allen had sold. Allen plans to crash the flight with the help of a blackmailed air traffic controller. Haran disables the flight's transponder, averting the crash thereby saving the lives of numerous passengers on board, but Allen manages to escape easily. However, he loses his hard drive after being exposed to the radiation of an MRI room.
Weeks later, Allen attempts to flee on a private jet. Haran, assigned as the Sky Marshal for the flight, confronts him mid-air. In a final fight, Haran kills Allen and his bodyguards, thereby ending his criminal enterprise and ensuring justice for all the victims.
