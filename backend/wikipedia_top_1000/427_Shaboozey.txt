Collins Obinna Chibueze (born May 9, 1995), known professionally as Shaboozey, is an American rapper, singer, songwriter, and record producer. His music combines hip-hop, country, rock, and Americana. His stage name originated from the mispronunciation of his last name, Chibueze - an Igbo word meaning "God is king" - by his high school football coach.
Following the releases of his first two albums, Lady Wrangler (2018) and Cowboys Live Forever, Outlaws Never Die (2022), Shaboozey gained recognition after featuring on two songs from Beyoncé's album Cowboy Carter (2024). He achieved commercial success with his third album, Where I've Been, Isn't Where I'm Going (2024), and its number one single "A Bar Song (Tipsy)"  as well as "Good News"; the former spent nineteen weeks atop the Billboard Hot 100, tying with Lil Nas X's "Old Town Road" as the longest running Hot 100 number-one song of all time.


== Early life ==
Chibueze was born and raised in Woodbridge, Virginia. His parents are Igbo Nigerians; his father was a farmer in Nigeria who attended college in Texas. In his childhood, he was inspired by hip-hop music videos on 106 & Park, as well as his father's cowboy style of dress and love of country music. For junior high, he spent two years at a boarding school in Nigeria. In 2013, he graduated from Gar-Field Senior High School in Woodbridge, Virginia, where he played football as a freshman. As a teenager, Shaboozey planned to be a novelist. However, by the time he graduated high school, in addition to earning money from shooting music videos and photography, he also earned "a few hundred bucks here and there" from music gigs and decided to take music more seriously.


== Career ==

In 2014, Shaboozey released his first single, "Jeff Gordon", referring to NASCAR driver Jeff Gordon. It is described as "a sparse trap song with a stealthy piano beat" and begins with overlapping audio from a NASCAR race.
Also in 2014, Shaboozey founded V Picture Films, a production company, with the goal of becoming a writer, director, and producer.
In August 2016, Shaboozey signed a recording, co-publishing and ancillary rights agreement with Terence Sheldon dba Homeless Records (assigned to Kreshendo Entertainment, a division of Republic Records, in September 2017), giving up 50% of the rights to his compositions while the agreement was in effect. The publishing agreement was terminated in November 2019.
In October 2018, Shaboozey released his debut studio album Lady Wrangler on Republic Records.
In 2018, Shaboozey was asked by Duckwrth to sing the hook for the song "Start a Riot". It went so well that Shaboozey was also asked to sing the second verse. The song, released in December 2018, was included in the soundtrack to Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse and led to national recognition for Shaboozey.
Shaboozey's second studio album, Cowboys Live Forever, Outlaws Never Die, was released in October 2022 via Empire Distribution. On the album, Shaboozey attempts to highlight the common themes between contemporary hip-hop and 19th century outlaw music in the American frontier.
In January 2024, after a member of Beyoncé's team heard Shaboozey's then-unreleased "A Bar Song (Tipsy)", Shaboozey was asked to sing on two songs with Beyoncé. The tracks were included on her eighth studio album, Cowboy Carter, released in March 2024. "A Bar Song (Tipsy)", which interpolates J-Kwon's 2004 single "Tipsy", was released in April 2024. The song spent nineteen weeks atop the Billboard Hot 100, tying with Lil Nas X's "Old Town Road" as the longest running Hot 100 number-one song ever.
Shaboozey's third studio album, Where I've Been, Isn't Where I'm Going, was released in May 2024. Though his earlier music had more of a trap influence, this album has more of a folk-pop sound with acoustic guitar. As of May 2024, Jared Cotter was Shaboozey's co-talent manager.
In November 2024, Shaboozey released "Good News". That month he also performed at the halftime show of the 2024 Chicago Bears–Detroit Lions Thanksgiving game.
In December 2024, Shaboozey was a musical guest on Saturday Night Live, where he performed "A Bar Song (Tipsy)" and "Good News". He also performed alongside Post Malone in the Beyoncé 2024 NFL Halftime Show at the Christmas Day Game between the Baltimore Ravens and the Houston Texans.
Shaboozey received nominations at the 67th Annual Grammy Awards for Song of the Year, Best New Artist, Best Country Song, Best Country Solo Performance, and Best Melodic Rap Performance.
