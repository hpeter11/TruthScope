== History ==
The former Odebolt–Arthur Community School District and the Battle Creek–Ida Grove Community School District, in 2009, started a "grade sharing" in which the districts sent their children to the same high school and shared personnel. There was a previous attempt to merge the districts in fall 2016, but voters from Odebolt–Arthur voted it down out of fear that their school would close. There were tensions between the Odebolt–Arthur and Battle Creek–Ida Grove communities. By 2018 the merger was approved.
