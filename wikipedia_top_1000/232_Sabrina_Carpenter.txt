Carpenter responded to the controversy by saying that advance permission had been granted and added that "Jesus was a carpenter". Bishop Robert J. Brennan relieved the pastor of his administrative duties and held a Mass of reparation which "restored the sanctity of this church and repaired the harm." Subsequent investigation into the priest who granted permission for Carpenter to shoot the video has been linked to a federal criminal investigation of New York City mayor Eric Adams.

== Artistry ==


=== Influences ===
Carpenter named R&B as a genre that often influences her work. She cited Christina Aguilera and Rihanna as her biggest musical influences. Carpenter stated that Aguilera's 2002 song "Beautiful" helped her "showcase and develop [her] own voice", citing Aguilera's vocals as an inspiration. She has also named Aretha Franklin, Whitney Houston and Etta James as early musical influences, she cited Beyoncé as her genre-bending influence, and cited Taylor Swift and Lorde as her songwriting influences. She claimed that Swift's live performances and work ethic have inspired her. In an interview with Rolling Stone, Carpenter said Madonna, Britney Spears, Mariah Carey, and Aguilera were some of the artists who introduced her to pop music.


=== Musical styles ===
Early in her career, Carpenter was described as a "teen pop singer". Later on in her career, Carpenter began to embrace pop music, with I.D. writer Barry Pierce noting that after the release of Emails I Can't Send, she "can rightfully claim the title of fully fledged popstar". Variety writer Thania Garcia noted that while Carpenter was "considered a Disney princess for years, her transition from child actor to pop star [...] has been slow, steady and intentional". Carpenter felt that her transition from a Disney-star was hard, with Pierce noting that she has since had more autonomy over her work. Carpenter noted in an interview with Vogue that her "prior music put forth a facet of herself that she didn't feel was authentic at the time". Her stage presence has also been praised with Vogue writer Chelsea Sarabia noting that "as an artist and performer, [Carpenter] wields the full range of human expression as if it were an instrument of its own".
Carpenter's albums contain elements of folk pop, acoustic, country, electropop and house music. Her albums post-Singular: Act I have delved into styles such as dance-pop, trap, hip-hop, and R&B. On her sound, Carpenter noted that her music has "elements of everything". In an interview with Variety in 2024, Carpenter noted that she felt separated from her albums pre-Emails I Can't Send, noting that it was "largely due to the shift in who I am as a person and as an artist, pre-pandemic and post-pandemic". Alex Hopper of American Songwriter remarked storytelling as a motif of Carpenter's songs. Carpenter's voice has been described as a soprano. 


=== Songwriting ===
Carpenter has co-written most of her songs, with sole lyricist credits for two tracks on Emails I Can't Send; she has stated in interviews that she is the main songwriter on her songs. Her preferred songwriting process is to start writing by deciding the song's title and building on from there, documenting her life experiences confessionally. Producer Jack Antonoff, who collaborated with Carpenter on the production of her sixth album Short n' Sweet, commended the way she weaved humor into her music and her songwriting voice. Antonoff mentioned that he worked solely on the music of "Sharpest Tool" with Carpenter handling the lyrics. Of Emails I Can't Send, Carpenter said "I would hope that if someone had never listened to my music before, and they listened to this album, they would leave it feeling like they know me better as a person."
Carpenter also worked on the compositions of some of her songs, including "Espresso" and "Please Please Please". She also performs her own musical accompaniment, with musical knowledge of the piano, bass, ukulele, guitar, and drums. She played the guitar during her set on the Short n' Sweet tour, and played the piano and electric guitar during her Coachella set in 2024.
