== College career ==

Pickett spent most of his true freshman season at Pittsburgh in 2017 as a backup to Max Browne and Ben DiNucci. He started his first career game in Pittsburgh's final game of the season against the second ranked Miami Hurricanes. During the team's upset victory, he completed 18 of 29 passes for 193 yards with a touchdown and also rushed for 60 yards and two touchdowns. Overall for the season he completed 39 of 66 passes for 509 yards, one touchdown and one interception.
Pickett returned as Pittsburgh's starter in 2018. He started all 14 games, completing 180 of 310 passes for 1,969 yards, 12 touchdowns and six interceptions. Pickett led Pittsburgh to their first ever Atlantic Coast Conference Coastal Division Championship in his first season as the full-time starter. The Associated Press ranked the Panthers as high as the No. 24 team in the country at one point in the 2018 season. The Panthers lost 14–13 to the Stanford Cardinal in the Sun Bowl.
Pickett was again the starter in 2019, making 12 starts and missing one game due to injury. He completed 289 of 469 passes for 3,098 yards, 13 touchdowns and nine interceptions. This was Pickett's first season with Mark Whipple acting as the offensive coordinator, who increased the amount of passes the offense threw each week. He led the Panthers to a 7–5 record heading into the postseason. The Panthers were selected to the 2019 Quick Lane Bowl in Detroit and defeated the Eastern Michigan Eagles 34–30. Pickett threw for 361 yards and three touchdowns, including a game winning touchdown to wide receiver Taysir Mack in the final minutes of the game.
Pickett and the Panthers played in a shortened season due to the COVID-19 pandemic, going 6–5. Pickett played in nine games and threw for 2,408 yards and 13 touchdowns and nine interceptions in that stretch. The Associated Press ranked the Panthers as high as the No. 21 team in the country at one point in the 2020 season. Despite being eligible for a bowl game, the Panthers collectively opted out of participating in the postseason.
The NCAA granted all 2020 fall athletes an extra year of eligibility, and Pickett used this option to return as the Panthers' starting quarterback in 2021.
Pickett took advantage of his final year of eligibility and broke out as one of the nation’s top players. He recorded 4,319 yards and 42 touchdowns setting school records for single season yards and touchdowns as well as career yards and touchdowns. Pickett was named a first-team All-American and was a finalist for the Heisman Trophy finishing in 3rd place. Pittsburgh won the ACC Championship and finished 11–2 in games Pickett started, the school's best record since 1976. He graduated with a bachelor's degree in marketing and enrolled at Joseph M.

=== Pre-draft ===

Various journalists scrutinized Pickett prior to the draft for his relatively small hands, measured at 8½ inches, believing it could make him more prone to fumbling the ball.


=== Pittsburgh Steelers ===


==== 2022 ====

Pickett was selected by the Pittsburgh Steelers in the first round (20th overall) of the 2022 NFL draft, the highest the Steelers selected a quarterback since drafting the then-recently retired Ben Roethlisberger in 2004; the selection was announced by Steelers legend Franco Harris in one of his last public appearances with the team before his unexpected death on December 20, 2022. With the starting quarterback position wide open following Roethlisberger's retirement, on September 6, 2022, Pickett was named the backup quarterback for the Steelers behind starter Mitchell Trubisky. Initially, Pickett was designated as the team’s third string quarterback behind both Trubisky and veteran Mason Rudolph. However, Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin would adjust the depth chart to put Pickett in the backup role citing a “clerical error” with the original depth chart.  
Pickett made his NFL debut in the second half of a Week 4 loss against the New York Jets after Trubisky was benched. He completed 10 of 13 passes for 120 yards and rushed for two touchdowns, but threw three interceptions in the 24–20 loss. On his first career pass attempt, Pickett threw a deep ball to Chase Claypool that was intercepted by Jordan Whitehead. In his second drive, Pickett scrambled into the end zone for his first ever touchdown in his NFL career.
On October 4, 2022, Pickett was named the starter by head coach Mike Tomlin. In his first career start against the Buffalo Bills, Pickett completed 34 of 51 passes for 327 yards and an interception in the 38–3 loss. In Week 6 against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Pickett threw his first touchdown pass to Najee Harris, but he exited the game during the third quarter with a concussion. The Steelers went on to defeat the Buccaneers 20–18, earning Pickett his first career win.
In Week 14 against the Baltimore Ravens, Pickett once again suffered a concussion. He was ruled out for Week 15 against the Carolina Panthers but started the following week against the Las Vegas Raiders in Week 16. In the game, he threw a game-winning 14-yard touchdown to George Pickens with under a minute left as the Steelers won 13–10. In Week 17 against the Baltimore Ravens, Pickett threw a game-winning touchdown with under a minute left for the second consecutive game; a 10-yard pass to Najee Harris. The Steelers won 16–13, keeping their playoff hopes alive.  Pickett became the first rookie quarterback in NFL history to throw a game-winning touchdown in the final minute of the fourth quarter in two straight games. He finished his rookie season with 2,404	passing yards, seven passing touchdowns, and nine interceptions to go along with three rushing touchdowns in 13 games.
On March 13, 2023, the game ball from the Steelers' victory over the Las Vegas Raiders was put on display in the Professional Football Hall of Fame.


==== 2023 ====

In Week 3, Pickett completed 16 of 28 passes for 235 yards and 2 touchdown passes in a 23–18 road win over the Raiders. It was his first professional game with multiple touchdown passes. A week later, he went 15 of 23 for 114 yards and an interception before sustaining a bone bruise late in the third quarter during their 30–6 road loss to the Texans. During the team's 24–17 road victory over the Rams in Week 7, Pickett scored his first rushing touchdown of the season on a quarterback sneak. In Week 8, during a 20–10 home loss to the Jaguars, Pickett suffered a rib injury late in the second quarter and did not return. However, Pickett started four days later against the Titans, leading the team to a 20–16 victory with a game-winning touchdown pass in the fourth quarter. In Week 13, Pickett suffered a high ankle sprain and was ruled out for the remainder of the game. He underwent surgery to accelerate the healing process on his ankle. In Week 18, he was listed as active for the first time since his injury, but was demoted to backup duties following the success of Mason Rudolph.
Pickett finished his season with the lowest touchdown percentage of all eligible starting quarterbacks in the league only throwing for six touchdowns out of 324 pass attempts across all 12 starts. He threw an almost identical amount of interceptions with four. His passer rating improved from 76.7 in 2022, to 81.4. 


=== Philadelphia Eagles ===
On March 16, 2024, Pickett was traded to the Philadelphia Eagles along with a 2024 fourth-round pick (No. 120; Jaylen Wright) in exchange for a 2024 third-round pick (No. 98; Payton Wilson) and two 2025 seventh-round picks following the free agent signing of Russell Wilson by the Steelers.
Pickett entered the season as the backup quarterback behind incumbent starter Jalen Hurts, despite a competition with Tanner McKee. On October 20, Pickett appeared in his first game as an Eagle during a 28–3 win over the New York Giants. He attempted one pass, but it fell incomplete. On November 10, during a blowout 34–6 victory over the Dallas Cowboys, Pickett would relieve Hurts, completing one of two attempts for five yards. In Week 16 against the Washington Commanders, Pickett replaced Hurts after he was ruled out with a concussion. He recorded one touchdown and an interception as the Eagles lost 36–33. During this game, Pickett suffered a rib injury but did not miss any plays. He was named the Eagles' starter for the following game against the Cowboys. He completed 10 of 15 passes for 143 yards, 1 passing touchdown, and 1 rushing touchdown as the Eagles defeated the Cowboys 41–7. He left the game midway through the third quarter with a rib injury.
At the conclusion of the NFC championship against the Washington Commanders, Pickett was substituted in for Hurts to kneel out the 55–23 victory, sending Pickett and the Eagles to Super Bowl LIX.  Pickett became a Super Bowl champion when the Eagles defeated the Kansas City Chiefs with a final score of 40–22. He finished the game at quarterback for the Eagles, handing the ball off, attempting one pass, and then kneeling out the win.
