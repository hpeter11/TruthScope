Barbie Hsu (Chinese: 徐熙媛; pinyin: Xú Xīyuán; 6 October 1976 – 2 February 2025), also known by her stage name Big S (大S; Dà S), was a Taiwanese actress, singer, and television host, best known for her leading role in the two seasons of the television series Meteor Garden (2001–2002). Hsu ranked 33rd on the Forbes China Celebrity 100 in 2010, 16th in 2011, and 45th in 2012.


== Early life ==
Hsu was born on 6 October 1976 to Hsu Chien and Huang Chun-mei in Taipei as the second child of three sisters. She had an elder sister, Hsu Si-hsien, and a younger sister, Dee Hsu.
Hsu’s paternal family owns a jeweler’s shop in Taipei, founded by her paternal grandfather, a waishengren from Tancheng County, Shandong. When she was young, her mother separated from her father due to pressure from his family on her to bear a son, along with his infidelity, domestic abuse, and gambling. Hsu’s mother raised her three daughters by working as a real estate broker but did not officially divorce Hsu’s father until the late 2000s, after Barbie and Dee agreed to pay off their father’s gambling debt.
In 1994, Hsu and Dee enrolled at Taipei Hwa Kang Arts School, after Hsu spent a year at the National Kuo Kuang Academy of Arts, whose military-style discipline prompted her to drop out. At Hwa Kang, the sisters befriended classmates Pace Wu and Aya Liu. Together with fellow artists Christine Fan, Mavis Fan, and Makiyo Kawashima, they formed a close-knit group known as the “Seven Fairies.”


== Career ==
While attending Hwa Kang, Barbie and her sister Dee were discovered by Chen Kuo-Chin, who signed them as a pop duo under the stage name S.O.S. (Sisters of Shu), a name given by Bing Wang, the producer of their first album Zhan Ling Nian Qin (佔領年輕) (1994). The duo gained popularity with their 1995 hit song, “Ten-Minute Love” (十分鐘的戀愛), but soon became embroiled in contractual disputes with Chen, leading to a brief career slump. As Chen's agency banned them from releasing albums under the original group name, they changed their name to A.S.O.S. (All Sisters of Shu). 
In 1996, the duo signed with TV producer and manager Wang Wei-Zhong, after which they shifted their career focus from singing to hosting, with their eighth and last album released in 2001. They co-hosted variety show Guess (1996–2000), entertainment news program 100% Entertainment (1998–2005), and cooking show Gourmet Secrets of the Stars  (2007–2008). The duo ended their management partnership with Wang Wei-zhong and established their own studios in 2010.

As an actor, Hsu rose to pan-Asian fame with her leading role of Shan Cai in Meteor Garden (2001) along with boy group F4. Besides the Chinese-speaking world, the show brought her fame in Asia (such as South Korea, Japan, Indonesia, Vietnam, the Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, and Singapore). The show earned her a nomination for the Best Actress at the 36th Golden Bell Awards and is credited with ushering in the idol drama genre and the golden era of Taiwanese TV shows. After a sequel Meteor Garden II (2002), where she reprised the role of Shan Cai, Hsu went on to star in TV dramas such as Eternity: A Chinese Ghost Story (2003), Mars (2004), where she reunited with F4 member Vic Chou, Corner with Love (2007), Summer's Desire (2010), as well as films such as Silk (2006), My So Called Love (2008), Connected (2008), Hot Summer Days (2010) and Reign of Assassins (2010). For her performance in Connected, she received the nomination for the Best Actress at the 28th Hong Kong Film Awards.
In addition to acting, Hsu published a beauty guide Beauty Queen in 2004, followed by a sequel in 2007. Both books became bestsellers across the Chinese-speaking world. Among the many beauty tips she popularized were the "red wine facial mask" and the use of the hair-loss treatment Rogaine on the eyebrows to enhance their thickness. 
After marrying Chinese entrepreneur Wang Xiaofei in 2011, she retreated from acting, but still appeared in variety shows and advertisements. From 2011 to 2012, she served as a stand-in host for Dee in the variety-comedy talk show Kangsi Coming. In 2018, she made her last film participation as a voice actress in the dubbed version of the Pixar animated film Incredibles 2. That same year, she hosted Chinese variety show Miss Beauty and participated in the marriage reality show Xing Fu San Chong Zou (幸福三重奏) with her then husband Wang Xiaofei. In 2019, she participated in Season 2 of Chinese reality dating series Dream Space (戀夢空間) as a commentator and in the Chinese travelogue series We Are Real Friends (我們是真正的朋友) with Dee, Mavis Fan and Aya Liu. She also co-produced Dee's Talk (2021–2022) hosted by Dee.


== Personal life ==


=== Relationships ===
Hsu dated Blackie Chen for seven years starting in high school. She dated South Korean singer Koo Jun-yup from late 1998 to 2000. They broke up due to the "dating ban" by Koo's agency. She dated actor Lan Cheng-lung from 2001 to 2005, followed by a two-year relationship with actor Vic Chou until early 2008.
On 16 November 2010, Hsu married Chinese entrepreneur Wang Xiaofei in Beijing. They held their wedding banquet on the island of Hainan on 22 March 2011. Just four days before their wedding, Hsu had a miscarriage and underwent a surgery to remove the foetus.
After Hsu married Wang, she stopped her vegetarianism of over ten years, which she had started after her pet dog recovered from an illness; according to Hsu, Wang's mother influenced her to give up vegetarianism so that she could bear children. Hsu and Wang had two children: a daughter born in April 2014 and a son born in May 2016. In 2017, Wang opened the S Hotel in Taipei, which was named after Hsu with a budget of NT$350 million and was closed in August 2024. In 2018, Hsu had an abortion after her embryo stopped developing, eight days before she began filming the marriage reality show Xing Fu San Chong Zou (幸福三重奏) with Wang. On 22 November 2021, Hsu and Wang announced their divorce amid mutual claims of infidelity and political differences over Taiwan.
After her divorce, Hsu and Koo Jun-yup rekindled their relationship. On 8 March 2022, they announced their marriage. In 2022, Hsu said that she had 10 tattoos, including at least two that Koo had tattooed on her, such as a tattoo of their wedding ring. Another tattoo of hers was made to cover up a longstanding burn mark.
In November 2022, Hsu sought enforcement of spousal maintenance at the Taipei District Court against Wang, claiming that he had failed to honor their divorce agreement since March of that year. Wang responded by stating that he continued to pay for child support and Hsu’s personal maintenance but did not wish to cover her family expenses—primarily the electricity bill for the house where Hsu and Koo lived—after Hsu remarried. Wang also alleged that Koo had met Hsu in 2018, a claim that Koo denied. Wang then put up a guarantee of NT$1,625,000 to halt the enforcement procedure against him.
In March 2023, Wang was charged under Taiwan's Personal Data Protection Act for disclosing Hsu’s personal information online. He denied the charges, leading to a public exchange of accusations between the former spouses. Hsu accused Wang of infidelity and physical abuse during their marriage, while Wang countered with allegations of financial improprieties and personal attacks. In August 2023, Hsu sued Wang and his mother Zhang Lan for defamation. At the time of Hsu's death on 2 February 2025, the second hearing of the case over dividing the matrimonial assets was to be heard on 27 February 2025.


=== Charity ===
Hsu was an active supporter of charity over the years, particularly advocating for women’s and children’s rights, animal rights and People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.


=== Health ===
Hsu was one of the first Taiwanese celebrities to publicly discuss mental health, including her battle with depression in 2000, from which she recovered after one year. She also had a long history of anorexia. Hsu experienced two miscarriages. In 2011, she had to terminate her pregnancy due to fetal demise, and in 2018, while pregnant with her third child, she underwent a miscarriage procedure after the embryo stopped developing. In 2017, after being hospitalized following a fainting episode, Hsu revealed that she had a pre-existing condition of mitral valve prolapse and a history of epilepsy, including a near-fatal episode during the birth of her son in 2016.


=== Death ===
On 29 January 2025, Hsu traveled to Japan during the Chinese New Year holiday where according to her sister, she caught influenza. She died in Tokyo on 2 February, at the age of 48. The cause of death was originally thought to be pneumonia, stemming from influenza complications, but later confirmed to be septic shock. The news of her death from influenza complications led to a surge in demand for influenza vaccinations in Taiwan and other parts of Asia. Hsu’s remains were cremated in Japan, and her ashes were returned to Taiwan on a chartered flight on 5 February. Her family saying that no memorial would be planned due to Hsu's preference to "keep a low profile" and that she would have a tree burial according to her wishes.
On 8 February 2025, Douyin indefinitely banned the accounts of Wang Xiaofei, Zhang Lan, and Xia Jian—Hsu’s former husband, former mother-in-law, and Zhang’s godson, respectively—for spreading false information about Hsu, though Zhang continued to livestream on TikTok, Douyin's international version. Weibo followed by stating that it had removed over 2,100 posts containing "the falsehoods from external sites" and imposed penalties on over 100 violating accounts, including the suspension of live-streaming on Zhang Lan’s account.
