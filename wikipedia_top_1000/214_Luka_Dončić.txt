== Early life ==

Dončić played various sports in his childhood, including football, which he later quit after growing too tall. At age seven, Dončić began playing organized basketball at a primary school in Ljubljana. His opponents at the time were up to 10 years old, as Dončić reflected: "I was always training and playing with older kids who had much more experience than me. Many of them were bigger and faster than me too, so I had to beat them with my brain." Dončić admired Greek basketball player Vassilis Spanoulis from his early teenage years, stating that he was "enchanted" by him. Dončić wore the number 7 at Real Madrid in honor of Spanoulis. Dončić also grew up admiring American basketball player LeBron James.

He became the first player in NBA history to record 250-plus points, 50-plus rebounds, and 50-plus assists over a five-game span.

On March 22, Dončić recorded 30 points, seven rebounds and a season-high 17 assists in a 127–125 loss to the Golden State Warriors.

He passed Wilt Chamberlain for fourth on the all-time 40-point triple-doubles list. Chamberlain had seven career games where he posted a 40-point triple-double, and now Dončić has eight such games. On December 25, Dončić put up 50 points, 15 assists, six rebounds, and four steals in a 128–114 victory over the Phoenix Suns. He reached 10,000 career points in the same game. Dončić became the sixth player to reach 10,000 career regular-season points before turning 25, joining LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Kobe Bryant, Carmelo Anthony and Tracy McGrady. Dončić tied Bob McAdoo for reaching 10,000 points in the seventh-fewest games in NBA history. He is the quickest player to reach 10,000 points among active players as of 2023 with 358 games. This is the fastest since Michael Jordan. Dončić is also tied for the third-most points for Christmas Day games, behind Bernard King and Wilt Chamberlain. 
On January 25, 2024, Dončić was named a Western Conference starter for the 2024 NBA All-Star Game, marking his fifth consecutive selection and his fourth selection as a starter. The next day, Dončić became the fourth player in league history to put up 72 or more points in a game and became the first player ever to score at least 70 points while shooting 75% or better from the field in a 148–143 victory over the Atlanta Hawks, finishing with a career-high 73 points (shooting 25-of-33 overall, with eight three-pointers made), setting a new franchise record, and with it being the most efficient 70-plus-point game in history. This marked the most points scored in a single game by any player since Kobe Bryant scored 81 points on January 22, 2006. Dončić's 33 field goal attempts were fewest field goal attempts needed to reach 70 points. His 41 points in the first half also set a Mavericks franchise record for the most points in any half, surpassing the previous record set by Dirk Nowitzki in December 2009. On January 27, Dončić recorded a triple-double with 28 points, 17 assists and 10 rebounds to become the first player in NBA history to average a 50-point triple-double over a two game span. Two days later in a 131–129 victory over the Orlando Magic, Dončić became the seventh youngest player to record 3,000 assists, and joined LeBron James as the only two players in NBA history to reach 10,000 points, 3,000 rebounds and 3,000 assists before turning 25 years old. 
On March 4, Dončić was awarded the Western Conference Player of the Month award for his play during the month of February, the fourth of his career. On March 9, Dončić recorded 39 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists in a 142–124 victory over the Detroit Pistons. He became the first player to record six consecutive 30-point triple-doubles in NBA history. On April 2, Dončić was awarded the Western Conference Player of the Month award for his play during the month of March, the fifth of his career. It marked the second time in Dončić's career that he averaged a 30-point triple-double during any calendar month. The only other players in NBA history to average a 30-point triple-double in a month are Oscar Robertson (5 times) and Russell Westbrook (twice). Dončić also became the first player in franchise history to earn the monthly award in consecutive months and joined Dirk Nowitzki as the only Mavericks to receive the honor twice in the same season. On April 9, Dončić put up a triple-double with 39 points, 12 rebounds, and 10 assists in a 130–104 win over the Charlotte Hornets, tying James Harden for eighth on the all-time career triple-double list. Dončić also surpassed Mark Aguirre's previous record of 2,330 points, for the most points scored in a season by a player in franchise history. Dončić finished the regular season as the first European to lead the NBA in scoring and the second international player to achieve the feat. Dončić finished the season's MVP race in third place. He was selected to his fifth All-NBA First Team, joining Kevin Durant and Tim Duncan as the only players with five All-NBA First Team selections before their 26th birthday, and also joined Larry Bird, George Gervin and Duncan as the only players to earn five-or-more All-NBA First Team selections within their first six seasons since the ABA–NBA merger. Dončić finished third in MVP voting behind Nikola Jokić and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander.
On May 15, 2024, in Game 5 of the Western Conference Semifinals against the Oklahoma City Thunder, Dončić delivered his sixth career playoff triple-double of 31 points, 10 rebounds, and 11 assists in a 104–92 victory.

In Game 5, Dončić put up 36 points and 10 rebounds to lead the Mavericks to defeat the Timberwolves, 124–103, and secure the Mavericks' third NBA Finals appearance in franchise history. He would also win the Western Conference finals MVP. Dončić became the sixth player in NBA history after Tim Duncan, Jason Kidd, LeBron James, Nikola Jokić and Jayson Tatum to lead their team in points, rebounds, and assists while reaching the NBA Finals. 
In Game 1 of the 2024 NBA Finals against the Boston Celtics, Dončić scored 30 points and grabbed 10 rebounds in a 107–89 loss. He became just the first player since Tim Duncan in 1999 to record a 30-point double-double in his first Finals game. In Game 2, Dončić became the first player in Dallas franchise history to record a triple-double in a Finals game. He finished with 32 points, 11 rebounds, 11 assists and four steals in a 105–98 loss. It was his 10th career playoff triple-double. In Game 3, he fouled out in the game with over four minutes remaining in the game. Dallas would go on to lose the Finals to Boston in five games despite Dončić's 28-point, 12-rebound, 5-assist and 3-steal outing in the 106–88 close-out loss in Game 5. He also finished the postseason as the leader in total points (635), rebounds (208) and assists (178), becoming the second player in NBA history to finish as the playoff leader in all three of those categories since Nikola Jokić pulled off the feat in the 2023 NBA playoffs.


==== Final season with the Mavericks (2024–25) ====
On December 7, 2024, Dončić put up a triple-double with 30 points, 13 rebounds, and 11 assists in a 125–118 win over the Toronto Raptors. He also surpassed Wilt Chamberlain and James Harden for seventh on the all-time career triple-double list. On December 16, Dončić posted his 80th career triple-double with a season-high 45 points (28 points in the first half), along with 11 rebounds and 13 assists in a 145–133 win over the Golden State Warriors. In a loss against Minnesota on December 25, he left the game with a strained calf, which was expected to sideline him for at least a month.


=== Los Angeles Lakers (2025–present) ===

On February 2, 2025, Dončić, alongside Maxi Kleber and Markieff Morris, was traded to the Los Angeles Lakers in exchange for Max Christie, Anthony Davis and a 2029 first-round pick. The Lakers also traded Jalen Hood-Schifino and a 2025 second-round pick to the Utah Jazz, who also acquired a 2025 second-round pick from the Mavericks. The trade was regarded as one of the most significant and unexpected in NBA history, marking the first time two reigning All-NBA players were traded for each other midseason. The Mavericks, who initiated the deal, drew heavy criticism for trading their franchise player, while Mavericks general manager Nico Harrison defended the trade, stating, "I believe that defense wins championships." Dončić on the other hand was blindsided by the trade; he was not told of it until the deal was done, according to Harrison. According to Chandler Parsons, Doncic had purchased a $15 million house in Dallas a week before the trade. 
At the time of the trade, Dončić had not played since Christmas Day as he had been sidelined with a calf strain. He recovered from his injury and made his Laker debut on February 10 against the Utah Jazz, scoring 14 points in 24 minutes as the Lakers won 132–113.

Dončić was previously linked with several other national teams, including Serbia and Spain. His national team roommate became Goran Dragić, whom he met at age seven and has been cited as his mentor and friend.
Dončić was a Slovenian squad member for EuroBasket 2017, where his country won its first gold medal after going undefeated (9–0) in the tournament. In Slovenia's 103–97 victory over Latvia in the quarterfinals, he scored 27 points and grabbed nine rebounds.

For his play during the tournament, Dončić was selected to the FIBA All-Star Five team, joining Patty Mills, Ricky Rubio, Kevin Durant, and Rudy Gobert as the five best players at the games.


==== EuroBasket 2022 ====
During the tournament's group stage, Dončić scored 47 points as he led Slovenia to the Round of 16 with a 88–82 victory over France, claiming the top spot in Group B. His 47-point performance was the second-highest scoring total in EuroBasket history. It was the most points scored by any player in EuroBasket history in the last 65 years. On September 10, Dončić scored 35 points while beating Belgium 88–72 to advance to the quarterfinals. The game marked his third consecutive game scoring 30-plus points, becoming the first player in tournament history in 30 years to do so. Slovenia was eventually upset by Poland 90–87 in the quarterfinals.


==== 2023 FIBA Basketball World Cup ====

== Player profile ==

Dončić has frequently been described as a "position-less guard" with attributes of a point guard, shooting guard, and small forward. Standing 6 feet 6 inches (1.98 m) and weighing 230 pounds (104.3 kg), he has been praised for his exceptional size and strength for the guard position. Dallas Mavericks executive Donnie Nelson lauded Dončić's "point forward ability" and sports website The Ringer labeled him a "legitimate point guard with the size of a small-ball power forward."
Since his early years with Real Madrid, Dončić was tabbed as one of Europe's premier talents, with Spanish newspaper Marca giving him the nickname "El Niño Maravilla" (The Wonder Boy). Entering the 2018 NBA draft, Dončić was widely seen as one of the best and most accomplished European prospects of his generation. Slam magazine considered Dončić the "best international prospect ever," and sports website SB Nation called him "most accomplished NBA prospect in decades." An anonymous NBA veteran scouting executive said that Dončić's game was "leap years above anyone" in his draft class.
Dončić is versatile on the offensive end, displaying proficiency in shooting three-pointers, mid-range jump shots, floaters, and shots in the post. His basketball IQ, intangibles, and skills have been considered his primary assets, and Dončić is seen as an elite facilitator, especially on the pick and roll. NBA and EuroLeague coach Ettore Messina called Dončić "phenomenal, especially mentally" for his age. His lack of lateral quickness to stay in front of most NBA point guards and wings has been labeled one of his main flaws. Dallas Mavericks head coach Rick Carlisle refuted some of the worries regarding Dončić's athleticism, stating that "for a 19-year-old, he's got a really unusual combination of size, speed, and deceptive quickness." By his second year, Dončić's ability to accelerate off a pick and blow by defenders to get to the basket was seen as one of his strengths. Given the false characterisation of Dončić's abilities and his subsequent success in the NBA, some speculate that prejudiced stereotyping had a role in his negative pre-draft evaluation.
Before his draft, basketball journalist and scout Austin Green compared Dončić to NBA players Paul Pierce and Joe Johnson. Dončić compared himself to Ben Simmons due to his versatility. In his second season, Los Angeles Clippers coach Doc Rivers, when asked about Dončić, stated that "there's a lot of people in him." He likened Dončić's stepback three-pointers to James Harden, his passing ability to Larry Bird, and his court vision to LeBron James. NBA analyst Kendrick Perkins called Dončić "baby LeBron" due to his overall skill and dominance on the court.
In December 2019, San Antonio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich called Dončić's playing style "Magic Johnson-like" because "he sees the floor in that same way." In August 2020, head coach Rick Carlisle compared Dončić's playmaking and court vision to Larry Bird and Jason Kidd. Milwaukee Bucks forward Giannis Antetokounmpo called Dončić "one of the most talented guys I've ever played against." During his first career playoff game against the Los Angeles Clippers, TV analyst and former point guard Mark Jackson, reiterated his view of Dončić, calling him "an absolute combination of Magic Johnson and Larry Bird."
In January 2024, former basketball player and Dallas Mavericks head coach Jason Kidd stated about Dončić that "he's better than Dirk [Nowitzki]" and that "he's in the atmosphere of [Michael Jordan], the best to ever do it, LeBron [James], Kobe [Bryant]".
