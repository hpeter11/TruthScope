=== Critical response ===
Rediff.com's Sukanya Verma wrote that "Loveyapa's lacklustre leads leave much to be desired" in an inferior remake of Love Today. Nandini Ramnath of Scroll.in considered it a "faithful, mechanical remake", adding that "the leads fit their roles in terms of age, they are sometimes hard-pressed to enact the ensuing mayhem". Rishabh Suri of Hindustan Times found the film "funny only in parts", and was critical of the film's "pacing issues". 
Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express thought that the film "lacks sizzle" and wraps important stuff in oodles of banality". While expressing disappointment over the lead performances, she considered Kapoor to have more potential than Khan. Titas Chowdhury of News18 was more appreciative of the film's humour as well as the performances of Khan and Kapoor. Vineeta Kumar of India Today was also appreciative of Khan's performance, but dismissed Kapoor's work. Justin Rao of The Hollywood Reporter India had mixed opinions on the remake and Khan's performance, but appreciated Desai's dialogues as well as Kapoor's potential as a "rom com actor in the making".


=== Box-office ===
Loveyapa had a poor opening weekend, earning just â‚¹4.25 crore (US$490,000) domestically.
