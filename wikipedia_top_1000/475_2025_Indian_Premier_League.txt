The 2025 Indian Premier League (also known as IPL 18 and branded as TATA IPL 2025) will be the 18th edition of the Indian Premier League. The tournament will feature ten teams competing in 74 matches from 21 March to 25 May 2025. Kolkata will host the opening ceremony and the final at the Eden Gardens as the defending champions.


== Background ==
The Indian Premier League is a franchise Twenty20 cricket league held in India, organized by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI). It is held annually since the first edition in 2008. Kolkata Knight Riders are the defending champions, having won their third title in the previous season after beating Sunrisers Hyderabad in the final.


=== Governing council ===

This will be the first edition following the unanimous appointment of Jay Shah, the former secretary of the Board of Control for Cricket in India, as the chairman of the International Cricket Council (ICC). He began his term in December 2024. Arun Singh Dhumal and Avishek Dalmiya will continue serving as the chairman and treasurer of the league till this edition.
Devajit Saikia and Prabhtej Singh Bhatia replaced Shah and Ashish Shelar as the new Secretary and Treasurer of BCCI respectively.


=== Format ===
Each team will play twice against the teams in their group and the team in the same row in the other group, and once against the remaining four teams in the other group. After the group stage, the top four teams based on aggregate points will qualify for the playoffs. In this stage, the top two teams compete with each other (in a match titled "Qualifier 1"), as do the remaining two teams (in a match titled "Eliminator"). While the winner of Qualifier 1 directly qualifies for the final match, the losing team will compete against the winning team of the Eliminator match (in a match titled "Qualifier 2"). The winner of this subsequent Qualifier 2 match will move on to the final match. The IPL Governing Council decided to keep the number of matches to 74 for this edition as it was in the previous three seasons to help the cricketers balance their workload, however it will be increased to 84 for the next two seasons. Seedings for the group stage are yet to be announced.


=== Schedule ===
According to ESPNcricinfo, the dates of the tournament window for the next three seasons (2025–27) have been sent to the respective franchises ahead of the 2025 auction. In November 2024, the tentative dates for the next three seasons were announced with the 2025 edition set to take place from 14 March to 25 May. In January 2025, it was announced that the 2025 season will commence on 21 March to keep a two-week gap from the 2025 ICC Champions Trophy final scheduled to take place on 9 March. This year's edition will coincide with the 2025 Pakistan Super League, which has been postponed from the typical February-March window due to the 2025 ICC Champions Trophy taking place in the February-March window this year.


=== Broadcasting ===

This will be the first IPL edition to be broadcast after the completion of the merger between Viacom18 and Star India, forming JioStar. Star India's Star Sports and Viacom18's JioCinema had acquired the satellite and digital broadcasting rights for 2023–27 IPL cycle respectively. Following the merger, both assets are now owned by JioStar and JioCinema is to be shut down in favour of Disney+ Hotstar, which previously held the digital broadcasting rights for 2018–22 IPL cycle.
