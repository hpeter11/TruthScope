The American rapper Kendrick Lamar has released 73 singles and five promotional singles. Thirty of those singles were as a lead artist, while forty-three were as a featured artist. According to the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), Lamar's digital singles registered 41 million certified units, based on sales and on-demand streaming, as of June 2024. On the US Billboard Hot 100, as of January 2025, Lamar has garnered five number-one songs, 88 total chart entries, 59 top-40 entries, 38 top-20 entries, 22 top-10 entries, 17 top-10 debuts, 14 top-5 entries, and three number-one debuts.
Although it was well received by music critics, Lamar's debut studio album Section.80 (2011) failed to produce any commercially successful singles. His first showing on international record and radio airplay charts came with his succeeding efforts, Good Kid, M.A.A.D City (2012) and To Pimp a Butterfly (2015). "Swimming Pools (Drank)", the lead single from the former album, marked Lamar's first entry on the US Billboard Hot 100 and the UK Singles Chart. Good Kid, M.A.A.D City also contained the moderately successful singles "The Recipe", "Poetic Justice", "Backseat Freestyle", and "Bitch, Don't Kill My Vibe". To Pimp a Butterfly was supported by five singles—"I" (which reached the top 40 in the U.S. and several European countries), "The Blacker the Berry", "King Kunta", "Alright", and "These Walls". Lamar's remix of Taylor Swift's single "Bad Blood" marked his first number-one song in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Scotland, and the U.S.
With his fourth studio album Damn (2017), Lamar became the fifth artist in history to chart at least 14 concurrent titles on the Billboard Hot 100. The album was preceded by "Humble", Lamar's second number-one track (and first as a lead artist) in New Zealand and the U.S. The International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) declared the single as the sixth best-selling song of 2017. Further bolstered by the international top 20 singles "Loyalty" and "Love", Damn became the first album by a rapper or solo artist to have every song featured be certified gold or higher by the RIAA. All eighteen tracks from Lamar's fifth studio album, Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers (2022), charted on the Billboard Hot 100; its successful singles comprise "The Heart Part 5", "N95", "Silent Hill", and "Die Hard". 
During his 2024 feud with Drake, Lamar released five commercially successful diss records. Two of them, "Like That" and "Not Like Us", debuted atop the American, Canadian, and South African charts. All twelve tracks from Lamar’s sixth studio album: GNX (2024), charted within the top-thirty of the US Billboard Hot 100 with seven tracks appearing in the top-ten—occupying the entire top-five. “Squabble Up”, the second track from GNX, debuted atop the Billboard Hot 100 and gave Lamar his third number one song on the chart of 2024 — causing him to become the first male solo artist to have three number-one-debuts in the same year. Not Like Us went on to win 5 Grammys at the 2025 Grammys on Feb 2 2025.
Lamar has worked with numerous artists on collaborative singles. His most successful endeavors include ASAP Rocky's "Fuckin' Problems" (2012), Robin Thicke's "Give It 2 U" (2013), Maroon 5's "Don't Wanna Know", and Travis Scott's "Goosebumps" (both 2016). Black Panther: The Album (2018), Lamar's soundtrack album for the film of the same name, produced the international top 10 singles "All the Stars", "King's Dead", and "Pray for Me".
