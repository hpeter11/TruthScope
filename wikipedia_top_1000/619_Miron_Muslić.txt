== Club career ==
Muslić came to Austria with his family during the turmoil of the Bosnian war and started playing football in the academy of FC Wacker Innsbruck in 1994 at the age of twelve. After the club disbanded, he played for Wacker Innsbruck from 1999. In October 2000, he moved to the second division club Wörgl. He made his debut for Wörgl in the second division in March 2001, when he was substituted for Markus Unterrainer at half-time on matchday 24 of the 2000-01 season against First Vienna.
Muslić moved to Novalja in Croatia for the 2002-03 season. After a season abroad, he returned to Wörgl in 2003. In September 2003, he scored his first second league goal in a 2-2 draw against BSV Juniors. With Wörgl, he was relegated from the second-highest division in the 2004-05 season.
He then moved to third division club Reichenau for the 2005-06 season, for whom he played 18 games. In the summer of 2006, he joined league rivals Hall. In the 2006-07 season, he scored 21 goals in 29 games for Hall in the Regionalliga West. He moved to Bundesliga club Ried for the 2007-08 season. He made his Bundesliga debut in July 2007, coming on as an 83rd-minute substitute for Jovan Damjanović on matchday three of that season against Austria Kärnten.
After four games in the Bundesliga, Muslić moved to third division club Gmunden during the winter break of the 2007-08 season. With Gmunden, he was relegated to the OÖ Liga at the end of the season. He joined league rivals Sattledt for the 2010-11 season. With Sattledt, he was relegated from the fourth-highest division in 2012. He then joined fifth-tier Union Weißkirchen in the summer of 2012, with whom he was promoted to the OÖ Liga in 2014.

== Managerial career ==


=== Early career ===
Muslić was assistant coach to Alfred Olzinger at Union Weißkirchen in 2014. From the 2015-16 season, he was also assistant coach to Thomas Weissenböck at Ried's amateur team.
From the 2017-18 season, he coached the Ried Under-18s team. In April 2018, he became Weissenböck's assistant coach with the first team at Ried. He also took over as head coach of Ried's amateurs for the 2018-19 season.
Following Weissenböck's resignation in November 2018, Muslić took over Ried as head coach on an interim basis for one match. In December 2018, he gave up his role as coach of the amateurs to work only as an assistant coach. After the 2018-19 season, he returned to the academy.
On 14 July 2020, Muslić was hired as a manager by Austrian Football Second League club Floridsdorfer AC. 
Muslić returned to Austrian Bundesliga club Ried in January 2021 and became head coach of the club. After ten games as coach of Ried, he resigned in March 2021, with the Upper Austrians picking up just three points in this period and remaining winless.


=== Cercle Brugge ===
In October 2021, Muslić became assistant coach to Yves Vanderhaeghe at Cercle Brugge. He also remained at the club under Dominik Thalhammer, and was promoted to the main first-team managerial role the following year, replacing Thalhammer on 19 September 2022. Helped by the goals of Japan international Ayase Ueda, Muslić steered Cercle from the relegation zone to a regular-season finishing position of eighth for the 2022–23 campaign, qualifying them for a streamlined version of the Belgian Pro League's European play-offs. They finished runners-up to Gent in these play-offs for the final European qualifying place, seeing them officially finish in sixth position.
With Ueda moving to Feyenoord, and Kevin Denkey promoted to become Muslić's first-choice striker, Cercle would qualify for the title play-offs for the first time, going on to finish fourth for the 2023–24 season, their highest finish since 2008, qualifying them for Europe for the first time in 14 years, and only the fourth time ever.
Early season struggles for the 2024–25 season did not clear, and after a 2–0 lead over bottom side Beerschot turned into a 2–3 defeat, Muslić was dismissed as Cercle manager on 2 December 2024.


=== Plymouth Argyle ===
On 10 January 2025, Muslić signed a three-and-a-half-year contract to become head coach of EFL Championship side Plymouth Argyle.
On 9 February 2025, with Plymouth in the bottom position in the Championship, Muslić's team met Liverpool at Home Park in the FA Cup Fourth Round and won 1-0. The win marked only the fourth time in FA Cup history that the leaders of the Premier League have been knocked out by a team outside the top flight.


== Outside football ==
Born in Bosnia, Muslić and his family fled to Innsbruck as refugees in 1992, when he was nine years old after his hometown came under siege. Speaking to BBC Sport, Muslić describes how, "[his family] had to leave Bosnia, and Bihac, our hometown, literally overnight, grabbing things you can grab with your hands."
He has three children with his wife, Ensada.
