"Abracadabra" is a song by American singer-songwriter Lady Gaga. It was released on February 3, 2025, through Interscope Records, as the second single from Gaga's upcoming eighth studio album, Mayhem (2025). The song's dance-pop energy and theatrical visuals have drawn comparisons to her earlier works. It has charted within the top 30 in Croatia, Germany, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The music video for "Abracadabra" premiered during the 67th Annual Grammy Awards ceremony.


== Composition ==
It is a dance-pop track with electronic and house influences. It features pulsating beats, hypnotic synths and a dramatic vocal delivery reminiscent of Gaga's early songs. Some journalists have compared its style to her The Fame Monster (2009) and Chromatica (2020) eras, with a dark, theatrical edge. A part of "Abracadabra" uses the melody of "Spellbound" by Siouxsie and the Banshees.
Throughout the song, the term abracadabra is used to represent magic, and a "lady dressed in red" is mentioned, which Gaga described as a symbol of "everything that challenges you and makes you question whether you can overcome it." She further explained, "In many ways, it's about how to deal with that challenge within yourself, and often, the world around us can reflect it as well. I wanted to explore the question: 'What does it feel like to thrive rather than just survive all the time?'".


== Release and promotion ==
Shortly after Gaga announced on January 27, 2025, that her next studio album would be titled Mayhem, it was revealed she would premiere a new single and video during the 67th Annual Grammy Awards on February 2. According to Variety, "Abracadabra" is a fast-tempo dance song.


== Critical reception ==
"Abracadabra" received acclaim upon its release, with critics highlighting its production, energy, and catchy chorus. Many compared it to Gaga's early works, noting its influence from late-2000s dance-pop, as well as its continuation of the dark electronic sounds explored in "Disease". Larisha Paul of Rolling Stone noted that Gaga is "always drawing upon her knowledge of the history of music" and described the song as "a showcase of her return to dark pop that pays homage to the influences that shaped her career." Robin Murray of Clash described "Abracadabra" as "a thrilling piece of pop music that moves from light to shadow with expert control." L'Officiel editor Alessandro Viapiana highlighted its "piercing rhythm and pulsating synthesizers, accompanied by a hypnotic voice that almost seems to evoke a ritual." Kyle Denis of Billboard described the track as an "explosive new dance-pop single" and highlighted its "high intensity", while pointing out that it builds upon the dark electronic elements introduced in her previous release, "Disease".
In their review, DIY wrote: "Make no mistake—Lady Gaga is back. Her latest single, 'Abracadabra,' is an unrestrained dancefloor anthem that takes us straight back to her The Fame Monster days in the late 2000s", adding that it revolves around a "brilliantly nonsensical yet irresistibly catchy chorus." Jenesaispop named it the song of the day on February 3, 2025, stating it "feels like stepping back into 2009, but with a production refined for today's era", while describing it as "a full-fledged dark electropop banger in classic Gaga style." Pitchfork's Walden Green remarked Gaga had not released a single "this good" since 2013's "G.U.Y.", writing, "'Abracadabra' delivers a latex-tight hook in true Born This Way fashion, though a closer listen reveals traces of over a decade of artistic reinvention: a touch of Chromatica in the house piano, and a full-throttle vocal turn that unmistakably stems from serious theatrical training.
Bustle noted the track is "a dancefloor smash tailor-made for her fans," and noted "as the title suggests, Gaga casts a spell with her new single, commanding listeners to dance all night." In a review for PinkNews, Marcus Wratten observed that "the song reaches its climax with a Europop-inspired chorus, followed by an energetic post-chorus where the megastar repeats the title with a fragmented syntax." Meanwhile, Milenio described it as maintaining "a pop-rock style, with moments of silence and a cappella segments that are distinctively Gaga."


== Commercial performance ==
On its release day, "Abracadabra" recorded 4.92 million streams on Spotify, marking Gaga's biggest debut on the platform with a solo song. Internationally, the song debuted at number ten on the Billboard Global 200 with 47.7 million streams, becoming the second top-ten entry from Mayhem, after "Die with a Smile".
In the United States, "Abracadabra" debuted atop the Billboard Hot Dance/Pop Songs chart and at number twenty-nine on the Billboard Hot 100 with a partial first tracking week, accumulating 13.7 million streams, 1.3 million radio audience impressions, and 10,000 downloads. With this feat, Mayhem became Gaga's first album since Artpop (2013) to achieve three top-forty entries on the Billboard Hot 100 prior to an album's official release. In the United Kingdom, it debuted at number six on the UK Singles Chart after only four days of tracking, marking Gaga's 17th top-ten song in the country and third from Mayhem, after "Die with a Smile" and "Disease".

=== Development ===
The music video for "Abracadabra" was directed by Gaga alongside Parris Goebel and Bethany Vargas. A nearly full-length teaser premiered during a commercial break in conjunction with Mastercard at the 67th Annual Grammy Awards and was later released on the singer's platforms. Gaga explained that the concept for the video originated after filming "Disease", when she and Goebel discussed continuing the album's narrative, exploring "these conflicting sides of ourselves that really don’t make sense but just keep having this discussion." The creative process, set preparations, and rehearsals lasted approximately three weeks, while the actual shoot took place over two days at a studio in Santa Monica in early December 2024. Gaga highlighted that sustainability was a key factor in the video's production, ensuring that only necessary materials were used and minimizing new manufacturing. Several white costumes were repurposed from old wedding dresses, deadstock fabric, and discarded textiles from her previous projects.


=== Synopsis ===
The music video opens with Gaga, standing on the upper level of a grand venue, dressed in a spiked red latex outfit. She declares, "The category is dance or die," setting off an intense choreography sequence featuring a crowd of forty dancers, all dressed in white. Throughout the video, the two versions of Gaga alternate: the white-clad Gaga exudes frenetic energy, while the red-clad version remains more composed, symbolizing a dance battle between light and darkness.
Speaking to Elle, Gaga explained the video's concept revolves around "being ready to face challenges," with the lady in red daring the audience to "dance for their lives." She also described the visual as a complement to the song, stating, "When you hear 'Abracadabra' for the first time, you might think, 'What is this about? It's fun to listen to, but what does it mean?' For me, watching the video makes it clear—it's about moving forward." Along with Goebel, who choreographed the video, Gaga announced a Priceless Experience contest in partnership with Mastercard to be in a fan video. Fans would have to perform the video's choreography with the social media hashtag #MastercardGagaContest.


=== Reception ===
Denis of Billboard stated that the clip evokes "Bad Romance" with "its meticulous display of the intersection of various art forms" as well as its "jaw-dropping high fashion" aesthetics. Rolling Stone writer Paul highlighted the video's frenetic choreography, describing it as "an eruption of chaos and movement," while also noting that "its aesthetics reinforce the concept of Mayhem and, along with the song, recall The Fame Monster era with its dark and theatrical visual style." Green of Pitchfork remarked like the music video for "Disease" it is "a high-concept production with impeccable styling. Gaga remains a step above the average pop star; her true competition is the ghosts of her own past." Eva Blanco Medina of Vogue España praised its striking opening, noting that the video begins with a clear message: "Dance or die," setting the stage for a "high-voltage choreographic showcase." HuffPost UK's Daniel Welsh declared it as "one of the best music videos of her career."
