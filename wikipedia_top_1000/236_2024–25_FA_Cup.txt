The 2024–25 FA Cup is the 144th season of the Football Association Challenge Cup, the oldest football tournament in the world. It is sponsored by Emirates and known as the Emirates FA Cup for sponsorship reasons. The FA Cup is the main domestic cup competition for men's football teams in England.
The qualifying competition began on 3 August 2024, with the proper tournament started on 2 November 2024. The final will be played at Wembley Stadium, London, on 17 May 2025.
Manchester United are the defending champions, having beaten their rivals Manchester City in the 2024 Final to win their 13th FA Cup title.


== Teams ==
The FA Cup is a knockout competition with 124 teams taking part from the first round proper, and all trying to reach the final at Wembley Stadium on 17 May 2025. The competition consists of the 92 teams from the Football League system (20 teams from the Premier League and the 72 in total from the EFL Championship, EFL League One and EFL League Two) plus the 32 surviving teams out of 652 teams from the National League System that started the competition in the qualifying rounds. The total 744 entrants was an increase of 12 from the previous season, and the most since 758 entrants were accepted in 2012–13.
All rounds will be drawn randomly, usually at the completion of the previous round (discounting any last games of a round being played), depending on television broadcasting rights.


== Rule changes ==
This is the first edition of the tournament to be played without replays in the proper rounds since the 2020–21 FA Cup and the first edition of the tournament to have the final played one week before the end of the Premier League season. The changes were made as part of a six-year agreement between The Football Association and the Premier League due to pressure on the domestic calendar from expanded UEFA competitions, but were criticised since replays were cited as an important source of revenue for lower league clubs. The agreement saw all round dates return to weekends, with previous editions having had some dates in midweek.
VAR will be used in all matches from the fifth round onwards (and none prior), whereas in previous seasons it was used for all matches held in Premier League grounds and at Wembley Stadium.
