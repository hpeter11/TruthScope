=== Critical response ===
For the first season, the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 74% approval rating based on 31 critic reviews. The website's critics consensus reads, "Bingeable as a beach read and just as forgettable, The Night Agent is a routine spy thriller told with commendable bravado." Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 68 out of 100 based on 13 critics, indicating "generally favorable" reviews".
Lucy Mangan of The Guardian gave the show 4 out of 5 stars, writing: "It is propulsive, slicker-than-slick fun, with every hairpin turn perfectly negotiated. There are fine performances—especially from Basso, who is getting two or three notes out of what could easily have been a one-note part." Comparing The Night Agent and Rabbit Hole in the New York Times, Mike Hale writes: "The two new shows are ... cheerfully, maddeningly implausible. Night Agent is on more of a meat-and-potatoes level... but it strings the viewer along in sufficiently teasing fashion to carry hard-core fans of the genre through its 10 episodes."
The second season has an 89% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 19 critic reviews, with an average rating of 6.8/10. The website's critics consensus states, "Growing more assured in its second season, The Night Agent executes its mission to entertain with no muss or fuss." On Metacritic, it has a weighted average score of 67 out of 100 based on 9 critics, indicating "generally favorable" reviews.
