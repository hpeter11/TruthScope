Donald Trump assumed office as the 47th president of the United States on January 20, 2025. The president has the authority to nominate members of his cabinet to the United States Senate for confirmation under the Appointments Clause of the United States Constitution.


== Cabinet ==

All permanent members of the Cabinet of the United States as heads of executive departments require the advice and consent of the United States Senate following appointment by the president before taking office. The vice presidency is exceptional in that the position requires an election to office pursuant to the United States Constitution. The president may also designate heads of other agencies and non-Senate-confirmed members of the Executive Office of the President as Cabinet-level members of the Cabinet. The Cabinet meets with the president in the Cabinet Room, a room adjacent to the Oval Office.
As the Republican Party controls the Senate, it is expected that all of Trump's designates will be confirmed with little contest. However, some nominees have been met with criticism by a few Senate Republicans.
On November 12, 2024, President-elect Trump announced that Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy would work together to lead the Department of Government Efficiency in his second term. Despite the name, it is unlikely to be a federal executive department, since official departments require congressional approval, and is more likely to be a component of the Executive Office of the President or a presidential commission working closely with the Office of Management and Budget. However, on January 20, 2025, Vivek Ramaswamy announced he would not be joining the Department of Government Efficiency.
Trump's cabinet choices were described by Business Insider and Reuters as valuing personal loyalty over relevant experience, and for having a range of conflicting ideologies and "eclectic personalities". It was also described as the wealthiest administration in modern history, with over 13 billionaires chosen to take government posts. Trump officials and Elon Musk threatened to fund primary challengers in upcoming elections against Republican Senators who did not vote for Trump's nominees.
The following have been named as Cabinet appointees by the President of the United States.

=== Trade representative ===
The U.S. trade representative has been a Cabinet-level member since 1974, the beginning of Gerald Ford's presidency. President-elect Trump selected former USTR chief of staff Jamieson Greer from Washington, D.C. to be nominated for the position on November 26, 2024.

It was previously a Cabinet-level member during the Clinton administration. The president-elect nominated former senator Kelly Loeffler from Georgia to be Administrator of the Small Business Administration on December 4, 2024.


=== White House chief of staff ===
The White House chief of staff has traditionally been the highest-ranking staff employee of the White House. The responsibilities of the chief of staff are both managerial and advisory over the president's official business. The chief of staff is appointed by and serves at the pleasure of the president; it does not require Senate confirmation. On November 7, 2024, Trump announced Susie Wiles from Florida as his choice for his chief of staff, having served as his 2024 campaign co-chair. Wiles is the first woman to hold the position.


== Acting Cabinet officials ==
Because cabinet members must be confirmed by the Senate, acting officials are typically appointed for the period before the Senate votes, in accordance with the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998.  For cabinet positions, only people who already actively hold a position confirmed by the Senate at the end of the previous administration are eligible, and they retain that position while they are detailed to the acting position.  Normally, a senior employee of the same executive agency who is equivalent to a GS-15 or above on the federal pay scale would also be eligible, but this is believed to be unconstitutional in the case of secretaries of the federal executive departments, although this has not been tested in court.


== Comparisons and contrasts to views of nominees in the nomination hearings ==
The nominees for the various cabinet positions answered questions in the respective Senate committee for the position that they were nominated for. Some nominees shared views on specific issues, while others differed on these views.


=== The role of the search warrant ===
CIA director John Ratcliffe and FBI director nominee Kash Patel both stated in their respective Senate nomination hearings that obtaining a search warrant for an investigation under Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) may be nearly impossible in situations where information is needed immediately, as might be in a hostage rescue situation or similar type of issues needing information moment by moment. In contrast, director of national intelligence nominee Tulsi Gabbard spent a large part of her time in her nomination hearing emphasizing the need for privacy of U.S. citizens when Section 702 is applied. Essentially, § 702(b) of the FISA Amendments Act of 2008 prohibits intention data gathering of a U.S. citizen in the process of an investigation of an issue overseas.
