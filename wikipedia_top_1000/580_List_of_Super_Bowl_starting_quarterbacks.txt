This is a list of National Football League (NFL) quarterbacks who have started in the Super Bowl.


== Winning and losing quarterbacks ==


== Quarterbacks with multiple Super Bowl starts ==

Super Bowl wins are often used to determine the greatness of a quarterback. Of the eligible players, only Jim Plunkett and Eli Manning have won multiple Super Bowls and not been inducted into the Hall of Fame. Peyton Manning and Tom Brady are the only starting quarterbacks to have won Super Bowls for two NFL teams, while Craig Morton and Kurt Warner are the only other quarterbacks to have started for a second team.  Jim McMahon won a second Super Bowl ring having been a backup on the Brett Favre-led Green Bay Packers team that won Super Bowl XXXI.

Starr was 3–1 in NFL Championship games (1960, 1961, 1962, and 1965) played before the NFL and AFL met in the first Super Bowl.
Dawson was 1–0 in an AFL Championship game (1962) played before the NFL and AFL first met in the Super Bowl.
Four pairs of quarterbacks faced off twice in the Super Bowl: Staubach and Bradshaw, Aikman and Kelly, Brady and Eli Manning, and Mahomes and Hurts. In three of the four cases, the same quarterback (Bradshaw, Aikman, and Manning) won both games.
