The 2024 NFL draft was the 89th annual meeting of National Football League (NFL) franchises to select newly eligible players. The draft was held at Campus Martius Park and Hart Plaza in Detroit on April 25–27, 2024. The draft had an attendance of over 775,000, breaking the overall record previously set in 2019. 
Six quarterbacks were selected in the first round—Caleb Williams, Jayden Daniels, Drake Maye, Michael Penix Jr., J. J. McCarthy, and Bo Nix—tying the record from 1983. The six were within the first 12 picks, with five in the top 10. Conversely, for the first time since the 1970 AFL–NFL merger, no quarterbacks were selected in the second through fourth rounds. Seven wide receivers were also selected in the first round, tying the record from 2004. A record 23 offensive players were selected in the first round, including 14 consecutive offensive players to start the draft.


== Host city ==
Detroit was chosen over Green Bay and Washington, D.C. as the host city on March 28, 2022. The city prepared to host the draft by undertaking beautification efforts, including construction work in various parts of the city and organizing a series of pop-ups to fill vacant storefronts downtown in time for the draft's visitors. 
The city installed the Detroit Sign, inspired by the Hollywood Sign in Los Angeles, to welcome visitors entering the city along Interstate 94. City officials claimed to have spent $230,000 of state grant money and municipal funds on murals. Additionally $1.53 million was said to have been spent on improvements to streets and traffic lights, as well as the planting of trees and beautification of roadway medians. The hosting of the draft was regarded to have been a success, with the city experiencing an estimated economic impact of $160 million.
As part of an effort to beautify the city, the city's Planning and Development Department, Downtown Detroit Partnership, and the City Office of Arts, Culture and Entrepreneurship partnered with Street Art for Mankind (SAM)'s "Be The Change" campaign to create seven sizable murals. The murals, however, became a subject of controversy. Criticism arose that international artists involved in the paintings may have been compensated below market rate for their work. The artworks became more controversial after the City Council refused to approve payment for the works, arguing that they had been approved without following the approval process imposed by the city charter. City employees' emails were later released under the Freedom of Information Act and revealed that department officials had considered the painting of buildings with historic designation without the required approval of the Historic District Commission.

== 2020 Resolution JC-2A picks ==
Since the 2021 draft, the league, under 2020 Resolution JC-2A passed in November 2020, rewards teams for developing minority candidates for head coach and/or general manager positions. The resolution rewards teams whose minority candidates are hired away for one of those positions by awarding draft picks. These draft picks are at the end of the third round, after standard compensatory picks; if multiple teams qualify, they are awarded by draft order in the first round. These picks are in addition to, and have no impact on, the standard 32 compensatory picks. Two picks were awarded for the 2024 draft pursuant to the resolution.
