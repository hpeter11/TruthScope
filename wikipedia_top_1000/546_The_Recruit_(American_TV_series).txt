=== Season 1 (2022) ===
Each episode of The Recruit bears CIA-like initials in its title. The codes, which are not unlike the multitude of initials for different divisions and projects that Owen Hendricks must understand in his role within the agency (codes Owen acknowledges at one point he has trouble keeping up with), represent a line of dialogue from their respective episodes.


=== Season 2 (2025) ===
Each episode title for The Recruit is a reference to an especially catchy line of dialogue in the corresponding installment, written out as an abbreviation.
