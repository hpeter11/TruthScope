XNXX is a French pornographic video sharing and viewing website. It was founded in 1997 in Paris, with servers and offices in Montreal, Tokyo and Newark. As of August 2024, it is the 39th-most-visited website in the world and the third most-visited adult website after Pornhub and XVideos.
XNXX is owned by WGCZ Holding, the same company that runs XVideos, another popular pornographic website.
A Business Insider ranking from 2018 placed it in the three most popular porn sites worldwide.


== History ==

XNXX was founded in 1997. WGCZ Holding's ownership was first revealed in 2014 when WGCZ brought a Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy case against a similar domain in 2014.
In March 2016, The Next Web identified WGCZ Holding as a Polish company headed by Stephane Michael Pacaud and Deborah Malorie Pacaud.
In 2018, the Government of India blocked XNXX, among other porn websites, after a Uttarakhand High Court court order demanding the same in a rape case where the perpetrators stated they were motivated to do so after watching online pornography.
In January 2023, The Financial Times  reported that WGCZ tube sites XVideos and XNXX receive 6 billion visits a month.
