Kevin Darnell Hart (born July 6, 1979) is an American comedian and actor. The accolades he has received include nominations for four Primetime Emmy Awards.
After winning several stand-up comedy competitions, Hart had his first breakthrough when Judd Apatow cast him in a recurring role on the TV series Undeclared (2001).

He has since released four more comedy albums: Seriously Funny (2010), Laugh at My Pain (2011), Let Me Explain (2013), and What Now? (2016).
He has since had roles in films such as Paper Soldiers (2002), Scary Movie 3 (2003), Soul Plane (2004), In the Mix (2005), Little Fockers (2010), Think Like a Man (2012), Grudge Match (2013), Ride Along (2014) About Last Night (2014), Get Hard (2015), Central Intelligence (2016), The Secret Life of Pets film franchise (2016–2019), Ride Along 2 (2016), Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie (2017), the Jumanji film franchise (2017–present), and Night School (2018).

In 2017, he launched the Laugh Out Loud Network, a subscription video streaming service in partnership with Lionsgate.


== Early life ==
Kevin Darnell Hart was born in Philadelphia on July 6, 1979, the son of Nancy Hart (died 2007) and Henry Robert Witherspoon (died 2022). He has an older brother named Robert. He was raised in a single-parent household by his mother, who worked as a systems analyst for the Office of Student Registration and Financial Services at the University of Pennsylvania. His father was a cocaine addict who was in and out of jail throughout most of Hart's childhood, prompting Hart to use humor as a way to cope with his troubled family life. His relationship with his father improved after his father recovered from his addiction. He would also later talk about his mother in his stand-up routine, portraying her as a loving yet intimidating woman.
As a teenager, Hart had aspirations of becoming a basketball player. He was a participant at the La Salle basketball camp with future National Basketball Association hall of famer Kobe Bryant and future political commentator and activist Marc Lamont Hill.
After graduating from George Washington High School, Hart briefly attended the Community College of Philadelphia before dropping out and moving to New York City. He spent some time working as a shoe salesman.


== Career ==


=== Stand-up ===
Hart's first stand-up performance took place at The Laff House in his native Philadelphia under the name of Lil Kev, which did not go well. His career suffered a slow start and he was booed offstage several times, once even having a piece of chicken thrown at him. After those initial unsuccessful shows, he began entering comedy competitions throughout Massachusetts, with audience receptions eventually improving. It took time for Hart to develop a unique comedic style. After an early period of attempting to imitate comedians like Chris Tucker, he found his own rhythm by delving into his insecurities and life experiences. He said, "Because of what I do, it has to be an open book. But right now this is a book that is being written."
Hart's comedy tours began in 2009 with his act titled I'm a Grown Little Man, followed by Seriously Funny in 2010, Laugh at My Pain in 2011, and Let Me Explain in 2013, the last two of which were also released as features in movie theaters. Hart grossed over $15 million from "Laugh at My Pain", making it one of the year's top-selling comedy tours. Hart also has a game app available through iTunes called "Little Jumpman". His Facebook page, Twitter account, and YouTube channel are all connected to and accessible through this app. Most overseas fans of Hart discovered him on YouTube, as well.
On April 9, 2015, Hart embarked on a comedy world tour titled the What Now? Tour at the AT&T Center in San Antonio, which concluded on August 7, 2016, at the Columbus Civic Center in Columbus, Georgia. On July 16, 2015, Universal Pictures announced that Kevin Hart: What Now?, a stand-up comedy film featuring a performance of Hart's What Now? Tour, would be theatrically released in the United States on October 14, 2016. The show was filmed live on August 30, 2015, in front of 53,000 people, at Philadelphia's Lincoln Financial Field.


=== Film and television roles ===

Hart had a guest appearance in the 2002 sitcom, Undeclared. He made his film debut in the 2002 film Paper Soldiers. Hart then had other films roles such as the Scary Movie franchise, Soul Plane, The 40-Year-Old Virgin, Death at a Funeral and Little Fockers. He turned down a role in the 2008 film Tropic Thunder because the character is gay, citing his own "insecurities".
He played Doug in the film The Five-Year Engagement (2012) and appeared in Think Like a Man which was a box office success. He also appeared in the sequel. He had a cameo as himself in This Is the End. In 2013, Hart played a boxing promoter in Grudge Match and appeared in Exit Strategy as Mannequin Head Man. He also appeared in 35 and Ticking.
In 2014, Hart starred as Ben in Ride Along, opposite Ice Cube. The film received generally negative reviews from critics, but was a major box office success. Hart returned in the sequel, Ride Along 2, which was released in 2016.
In 2013, Hart co-created Real Husbands of Hollywood with Chris Spencer. The show follows Hart along with other married celebrities (each playing a comical fictionalized version of themselves) within the series including: Boris Kodjoe, Nelly, Duane Martin, J.B. Smoove, Nick Cannon and Robin Thicke. Thicke did not return for the second season due to his music career, though Hart has stated that the door is open for him to return. The series is filmed in a style similar to Bravo's The Real Housewives. Episodes often hinge on the "real" Hart's desperately unsuccessful attempts to climb Hollywood's celebrity social ladder (which always backfire in humiliating ways), and the character's barely-hidden envy of his more successful celebrity friends. A sneak peek was shown as a segment during the 2012 BET Awards and the official promo was released in October 2012.

In 2015, Hart starred in the films Get Hard with Will Ferrell and The Wedding Ringer. In 2016, he starred in the movies Central Intelligence, with Dwayne Johnson and the animated The Secret Life of Pets.

In 2018, he produced his first film under his production company HartBeat Productions, Night School. In October 2018, his production company announced that he signed a first-look deal with Nickelodeon.

In 2019, Hart's film The Upside, his first headlining role in a drama, was theatrically released. It also starred Bryan Cranston and Nicole Kidman. Hart also reprised his role of Snowball in the sequel The Secret Life of Pets 2, and Franklin Finbar in Jumanji: The Next Level.

Hart signed a first look deal with Netflix in January 2021. He later played Arnold Drummond in the Diff'rent Strokes portion of the third edition of Live in Front of a Studio Audience.

Hart has aggressively expanded LOL's reach since its founding, securing partnership deals with PlutoTV, Roku, Snap, Facebook, Peacock, and YouTube. In 2020, he extended his company's agreement with Sirius XM.

=== Hosting ===
In addition to acting, Hart has also hosted various ceremonies. Hart first hosted the 2011 BET Awards. Hart then hosted the 2012 MTV Video Music Awards, after his longtime friend Judd Apatow, the director who gave him his first big on-screen break in the TV series Undeclared, recommended him for the position. Hart hoped this would project him into a side career as an emcee, stating, "Hopefully after MTV, of course we're talking Emmys, Oscars, whatever." From 2013–2015, he hosted three episodes of Saturday Night Live. In 2015, Hart hosted the Comedy Central Roast of Justin Bieber. In 2016, Hart co-hosted the 2016 MTV Movie Awards with Dwayne Johnson.
In September 2018 Hart has hosted HQ Trivia with Scott Rogowsky and gave away $100,000 to one person.
On December 4, 2018, Hart was announced as the host of the 2019 Academy Awards. Two days later, however, he withdrew from hosting duties in the wake of backlash against him over several homophobic tweets he had posted between 2010 and 2011. He characterized the protest as unconstructive and argued, "If you don't believe people change, grow as they get older, I don't know what to tell you". On December 7, he tweeted an apology to the LGBTQ community following criticism for not issuing one the previous day. On January 3, 2019, Hart stated that he was going to reconsider stepping down as host, after openly lesbian comedian Ellen DeGeneres, who has hosted the Academy Awards multiple times, expressed support for him to do so and said she had contacted the Academy to ask if Hart would be able to reverse his decision if he wished and, according to DeGeneres, they said he would be able to do so. On January 8, following backlash for what was perceived as an insincere apology by critics, Hart confirmed that he would not be hosting the Academy Awards. That year's ceremony was ultimately held without a host.
In September 2020, executives from the Muscular Dystrophy Association (MDA) announced plans to relaunch their annual MDA telethon and make Hart its new host, taking over duties that had been held from 1966 to 2010 by comedian and former National MDA Chairman Jerry Lewis. Entitled The MDA Kevin Hart Kids Telethon, the two-hour telethon was held on October 24, 2020, and was seen exclusively through participating social media platforms.
In 2024, Hart hosted the Netflix special The Roast of Tom Brady.

=== Hart House ===
In August 2022, Hart debuted a vegan restaurant, Hart House, to compete with fast-food chains by "offering flavorful plant-based alternatives". The restaurant opened in Los Angeles, California, about a mile from Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), with a simple menu of veggie burgers and Chick'n products. The restaurant's offerings are claimed to be "entirely free of cholesterol, antibiotics, hormones, artificial colors, preservatives, high-fructose corn syrup, or trans fats", and inspired by Hart's own "health nut" lifestyle.
Hart opened a second location in Monrovia, California, in November 2022, a third on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood, California, in May 2023, and a fourth location near the University of Southern California campus in June 2023. All locations closed down in September 2024.

Hart married Torrei Skipper in 2003, and they filed for divorce in 2010 after citing irreconcilable differences. Hart requested joint custody of their two children, a daughter born in 2005 and a son born in 2007. The divorce was finalized in November 2011.

=== Injuries ===
On September 1, 2019, Hart was a passenger in a 1970 Plymouth Barracuda that went off Mulholland Highway and rolled down an embankment near Calabasas, California. He and the driver reportedly suffered "major back injuries" and were taken to separate hospitals. Hart was released from the hospital 10 days later, and continued recovery at a rehabilitation facility.
On August 23, 2023, Hart ran a 40-yard race with former National Football League running back Stevan Ridley, and tore his lower abductors on his abdomen. He required a wheelchair as part of his recovery and said afterward he is the "dumbest man alive" and "the age 40 is real", recommending no one attempt to race like he did.


=== Legal issue ===
On April 14, 2013, Hart was charged on suspicion of drunk driving after his vehicle nearly collided with a tanker truck on a Southern California freeway. He failed a field sobriety test and was booked for misdemeanor driving under the influence. On August 5, he was sentenced to three years of probation after pleading no contest to one count of driving under the influence of alcohol.


=== Height ===
Kevin Hart's height has been a subject of public curiosity and varying reports, with sources listing him anywhere between 5'2" and 5'5". In an April 2024 interview on 60 Minutes, Hart clarified his actual height, stating, "I'm 5-foot-5, like with a shoe on, like a sneaker. Now, if I put a boot on, I can get to 5'5" and a half." This clarification came after discrepancies in media reports, such as GQ listing him at 5'5" and the Los Angeles Times at 5'4". Hart often incorporates humor about his stature into his stand-up routines.
