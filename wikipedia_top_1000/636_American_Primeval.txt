== Production ==


=== Development ===
The six-part series was written by Mark L. Smith and directed by Peter Berg. Berg, via Film 44, and Eric Newman, via Grand Electric, are executive producers. It was commissioned by Netflix in December 2022. Smith is also an executive producer on the series.
Berg has said he was inspired to create the series after reading about the Utah War and the Mountain Meadows Massacre and started researching it. The series incorporates real events, such as the massacre depicted in the pilot, along with the stories of actual people who lived during the 1857 Utah War. Real-life characters such as Jim Bridger, a pioneer caught between warring factions; Brigham Young, the leader of the LDS Church who commanded his army known as the Nauvoo Legion; and Wild Bill Hickman, a lawman and a member of this militia, were incorporated. Berg and Smith met with authors of books about the Massacre and visited the massacre site to try to gain as comprehensive an understanding of how that event happened as possible. Julie O'Keefe served as the show's Indigenous consultant.


=== Casting ===
Taylor Kitsch was confirmed in a lead role in late 2022. In January 2023, Dane DeHaan, Jai Courtney, Betty Gilpin, Shea Whigham, Kyle Davis, Nick Hargrove, Derek Hinkey, Saura Lightfoot-Leon, Preston Mota, Shawnee Pourier and Joe Tippett joined the cast.


=== Filming ===
Filming took place in New Mexico from February 2023, with filming interrupted by the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike. Kitsch suffered a broken foot during the production. Filming ran for 130 days of which only two days were on indoor sets. The New Mexico locations used included the small towns of 
Cochiti Pueblo and Santa Clara Pueblo, sound stages in Santa Fe, and Pajarito Ski Mountain, as well as the Bonanza Creek Ranch in northern New Mexico and the Charles R Ranch near Santa Fe. The set builders used only tools available in the 1800s to construct its version of Fort Bridger.


== Music ==
Explosions in the Sky, the post-rock band that previously worked with Berg on the Friday Night Lights film (2005) and Lone Survivor (2013), composed the series music. Netflix Music has released the series' soundtrack.

=== Critical response ===
On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, American Primeval has a critic approval rating of 68% based on 53 reviews, with an average rating of 6.5/10. The website's critics consensus reads, "Handsomely shot and thoroughly grim, American Primeval drives home its point about a nation's bone-deep savagery to persuasive, and sometimes deadening, effect". Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 59 out of 100 based on 27 critics, indicating "mixed or average" reviews.


=== LDS Church response ===
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints released a statement condemning the show for being "dangerously misleading", and said "[as] to the Mountain Meadows Massacre, which the series inaccurately portrays as reflective of a whole faith group, the Church has long acknowledged and condemned this horrific tragedy. It has also taken significant steps to uncover and share the full truth of what happened and promote healing". The statement also denounced the portrayal of Brigham Young as "egregiously mischaracterized", and called for people to be peacemakers.
