This is a list of the highest-scoring games in the history of the National Football League, by number of combined points. It includes both regular season and postseason games. The highest-scoring game overall was a 1966 game between the Washington Redskins and New York Giants, which produced a combined 113 points with a score of 72-41. The most points scored by one team in a single game is the 73 the Chicago Bears scored in the 1940 NFL Championship Game, which is not included on this list, as their opponents scored zero additional points. It also serves as the game with the largest margin of victory in NFL history. 
Scoring can be achieved through touchdowns (6 points), point after touchdown (1 point), two-point conversion (2 points), a safety (1–2 points) or a field goal (3 points). In the event of a  tie after four quarters, the overtime period allows scores to increase further as teams try to win it out of regulation.

Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning completed 33 of 42 passes for 414 yards, throwing 4 touchdown passes and 1 interception in a winning effort. This performance prompted KCNC-TV to report, "After 5 games and 5 big wins, the Broncos are on pace to become the first team in the history of the NFL to exceed 600, maybe even 700 points, in a season. It is the most remarkable five-game stretch in the history of professional football. The numbers don't lie. What Manning has done in his first five games – his "assault" on the record books – is simply unprecedented." This would prove to be true, as the Broncos stormed all the way to score 606 points and set the NFL record for points scored in a single season.

If they would have successfully scored the touchdown, they would have the highest-scoring Super Bowl of all time. The 35 points the Eagles scored is the highest by any Super Bowl-losing team in history.
