Patrick Lavon Mahomes (born August 9, 1970) is an American former professional baseball pitcher. He played in Major League Baseball from 1992 to 2003 with the Minnesota Twins, Boston Red Sox, New York Mets, Texas Rangers, Chicago Cubs and Pittsburgh Pirates. Mahomes also pitched in two seasons in Nippon Professional Baseball, 1997 and 1998 with the Yokohama BayStars. He last played with the Grand Prairie AirHogs of the independent American Association in 2009.


== Early life and amateur career ==
Mahomes was born in Texas, one of three children. His father worked for a local oil company and coached Mahomes' youth baseball team. His mother worked as a nurse until Mahomes was seven years old when she suffered a car accident which left her requiring the use of a wheelchair.
Mahomes attended Lindale High School in Lindale, Texas, where he played baseball, football and basketball. He was an intense competitor and, according to his parents, would cry or refuse to eat or talk after every loss in high school. He was also a member of the National Honor Society and had the second-highest grade point average in his graduating class.
Mahomes was only 5 ft 9 in (1.75 m) as a high school junior but earned all-state honors as a football quarterback and averaged 30 points per game in basketball, nonetheless. On the baseball field, he played shortstop and pitched. He received scholarship offers to play all three sports collegiately but most strongly considered a scholarship offer to play college baseball and walk on to the basketball team at the University of Arkansas.

Drafted in the sixth round in June 1988, Mahomes began his professional career with the Elizabethton Twins that same year as a starting pitcher. Over the next few years, he worked his way up through the Minnesota Twins farm system, reaching Triple-A in 1991 with the Portland Beavers.

=== Legal issues ===
Mahomes has been arrested multiple times for driving while intoxicated (DWI), most recently on February 4, 2024—the number of arrests has been reported as three or six, varying by source. The trial for his February 2024 DWI arrest is slated to begin in late July 2024. In August 2024, it was revealed in court documents that Mahomes has been criminally charged with DWI on three occasions, with his two prior charges occurring September 12, 2008, in South Dakota and on February 26, 2019, in Smith County, Texas.
On July 12, 2024, court documents obtained by TMZ revealed that Mahomes had also been driving with a driver's license that was invalid due to his ongoing DWI case. This was discovered on June 29, 2024, when was he pulled over in Tyler, Texas, for disregarding traffic signs. He was issued a traffic ticket for the invalid driver's license and issued a warning for disregarding the traffic signs. For this traffic citation, he was required to make a court appearance on July 31, 2024. On August 27, 2024, Mahomes pled guilty in the Smith County court in Tyler, Texas to his third DWI charge. Under the plea deal, Mahomes agreed to serve five years of probation and one year of "intense supervision," with his sentencing hearing scheduled for September 23, 2024. At sentencing, Judge Kerry L. Russell imposed in addition to the five years of probation an order requiring Mahomes to spend 10 days in jail, suspending his license for one year and specified that he be subject to "intense supervision" during the first year of probation.
