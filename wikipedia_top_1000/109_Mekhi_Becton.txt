Mekhi Becton Sr. (born April 18, 1999) is an American professional football offensive guard for the Philadelphia Eagles of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football at Louisville and was selected by the New York Jets in the first round of the 2020 NFL draft.


== Early life ==
Becton attended Highland Springs High School in Highland Springs, Virginia. He was regarded as a three-star prospect, ranked as the No. 43 offensive tackle and No. 405 overall recruit in the 247Sports Composite. Becton was recruited by 31 schools to play football, but by February 1, 2017, National Signing Day, he had narrowed the choice to five schools: Louisville, Virginia, Virginia Tech, Michigan, and Oregon. While he had been heavily recruited by Virginia, he ultimately chose Louisville on signing day.


== College career ==
Becton played as a freshman in the 2017 season. During his freshman year, Becton played in 13 games and started 11 for the Cardinals at the tackle position. During the first 4 games of the season, Becton was the highest rated freshman in the country by Pro Football Focus, and during the 7 he was the best pass-blocker in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC), allowing only 6 pressures in 312 snaps.
Becton was named a starting tackle for the 2018 season and started every game, bringing his total number of games started to 23 by the end of the season. Becton was again named a starting tackle for the 2019 season.  He received first team All-ACC honors after the conclusion of the regular season. Becton decided to forgo his senior season and sit out Louisville's bowl game, and declared for the 2020 NFL draft.


== Professional career ==


=== New York Jets ===
Becton was selected in the first round with the 11th overall pick by the New York Jets in the 2020 NFL draft.

On September 12, 2021, Becton suffered an apparent knee injury and was carted off the field. It was revealed that Becton had suffered cartilage damage, which required surgery, putting him out for 4â€“6 weeks. He was placed on injured reserve on September 14, 2021.
On July 27, 2022, after George Fant was moved to left tackle, Becton was shifted to right tackle. On August 8, during training camp, Becton was diagnosed with an avulsion fracture of his right kneecap. Eight days later, the Jets placed him on injured reserve, and he missed the entire 2022 season.
Becton was healthy in 2023, but did not play well. He started 16 games.


=== Philadelphia Eagles ===
On April 29, 2024, Becton signed a one-year contract with the Philadelphia Eagles. With little chance of gaining a starting spot at the tackle position, he was given the opportunity to move to guard. The transition was so successful that he quickly became the Eagles starting right guard. He started 15 games and helped the Eagles win Super Bowl LIX against the Kansas City Chiefs.
