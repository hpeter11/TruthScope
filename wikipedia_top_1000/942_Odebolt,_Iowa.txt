Odebolt is a city in Sac County, Iowa, United States. The population was 994 at the time of the 2020 census.


== History ==
Odebolt was platted in 1877 when the Chicago & Northwestern Railway was extended to that point. Odebolt was incorporated as a city May 13, 1878.
While the etymology of Odebolt's unusual name is unquestioned — being named after the Odebolt Creek — the etymology of the creek's name is disputed.  It has been ascribed to a story of a French fur trapper and to multiple stories of a bolt falling in the creek.  The trapper's name was reportedly Odebeau, and his name corrupted.
