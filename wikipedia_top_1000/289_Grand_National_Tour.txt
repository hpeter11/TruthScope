The Grand National Tour is an upcoming co-headlining concert tour by American rapper Kendrick Lamar and American singer-songwriter SZA, in support of Lamar's sixth studio album, GNX (2024). The first all-stadium tour for both artists, it consists of 36 shows across North America and Europe. The tour is scheduled to commence on April 19, 2025, in Minneapolis, and conclude on August 9, 2025, in Stockholm, Sweden.


== Background ==
Kendrick Lamar and SZA are former labelmates from Top Dawg Entertainment (TDE). For over a decade, the two have collaborated on musical projects, beginning with SZA's 2014 extended play Z. They previously toured with other artists from TDE during the Championship Tour (2018), although SZA was pulled from a number of dates due to swollen vocal cords.
On December 3, 2024, Lamar and SZA announced their co-headlining Grand National Tour. The announcement was made 11 days after the release of Lamar's sixth studio album GNX, which included two collaborations with SZA. Like the album, the tour was named after the 1987 Buick Grand National Experimental.
The Grand National Tour is expected to run for 23 shows across the United States and Canada. Due to high demand, Los Angeles and Toronto each got one additional concert after the initial announcement. Two pre-sale options were made available on December 4, 2024: one through the tour's sponsor Cash App and the other via Ticketmaster's Official Platinum program.
On February 10, 2025, European dates for the tour were announced, expanding the total amount of shows to 36. Tickets are going on sale on February 14, with various presales running from February 12 to 13.
