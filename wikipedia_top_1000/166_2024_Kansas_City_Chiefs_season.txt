The 2024 season was the Kansas City Chiefs' 55th in the National Football League (NFL), their 65th overall and their twelfth under head coach Andy Reid. The Chiefs entered the season as the defending champions for the second straight year and attempted to become the first team in the Super Bowl era to win three straight Super Bowl championships. The Chiefs started 9–0 for the first time since 2013 and became the last undefeated team in the NFL following their Week 7 win over the San Francisco 49ers coupled with the Minnesota Vikings losing to the Detroit Lions earlier that day. 
Following a Week 10 win over the Denver Broncos, the Chiefs secured their twelfth consecutive winning season. Their hopes of going undefeated were dashed following a Week 11 road loss to the Buffalo Bills. They clinched their tenth straight playoff berth following a Week 13 win over the Las Vegas Raiders on Black Friday coupled with the Miami Dolphins losing to the Green Bay Packers the previous day, and with a Week 14 win over the Los Angeles Chargers, the Chiefs clinched their ninth consecutive AFC West title, a record-extending 17th AFC West title, and improved on their 11–6 record from the previous season. Following a Week 16 win over the Houston Texans, the Chiefs went undefeated at home for the first time since 2003. Following a Week 17 road win over the Pittsburgh Steelers on Christmas Day, the Chiefs clinched a first-round bye and home-field advantage throughout the AFC playoffs as the top seed. They were also the first team to win at least 15 games since the 2015 Carolina Panthers, set a new franchise regular season win record, and became one of the first two teams to win 15 games in a 17-game season, along with the Detroit Lions, and the first AFC team to do so. Although they did win 15 games, they never scored more than 30 points in a game all season, becoming the first two-time defending champion to not score more than 30 points since the 1956 Cleveland Browns, as well as 11 of their wins being within one score. Their point differential of +59 is the worst of all teams to finish with three or fewer losses since the 1970 AFL–NFL merger outside of the strike-shortened 1982 season. 
The Chiefs were heavily accused of receiving favorable treatment from officials throughout the season by viewers, allegations the NFL has denied, and that the referee union found "insulting" and "ridiculous". Despite the NFL’s statement, viewers  continued to criticize the NFL, and some called for a Super Bowl boycott.

In the Divisional Round, the top-seeded Chiefs defeated the Houston Texans 23–14 to advance to their seventh consecutive AFC Championship Game (only trailing the 2011-2018 Patriots for the most ever) as Andy Reid became the fourth head coach to pass 300 wins, including postseason. The Chiefs defeated the Buffalo Bills 32–29 in the AFC Championship Game to advance to their third straight Super Bowl, becoming the first team that have won back-to-back Super Bowls to play for a possible third consecutive title. The Chiefs' attempt at a three-peat ended with a blowout loss in Super Bowl LIX to the NFC champion Philadelphia Eagles, 22–40, becoming the seventh consecutive team with 15 wins in the regular season to fail to win the Super Bowl.

As the Chiefs had already clinched the number one seed, they rested the vast majority of their starters for the entire game.
