== Controversies ==
On March 15, 2019, Atishi Marlena and three other party leaders were summoned to court in response to a defamation case filed by the Delhi BJP's vice-president, Rajeev Babbar. The case stemmed from their claim that the BJP had removed 30 lakh names from Delhi's voter list. The court found the allegation prima facie defamatory and invoked Section 500 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) for defamation. The case revolved around allegations of voter list manipulation and its impact on the BJP's reputation. 
BJP leader Praveen Shankar Kapoor filed a defamation suite in 2024 against Marlena and Kejriwal over the allegations of poaching.
After being elected CM, Marlena was set to move into the CM's residence, a bungalow on 6, Flagstaff Road, on 7 October 2024. However, on 9 October, the AAP alleged that the BJP had failed to allot the bungalow to her and that they were trying to "usurp" it, showing documentation that Kejriwal had already vacated the bungalow. The BJP responded by claiming that Kejriwal still had the keys to the bungalow and had failed to transfer them to Marlena himself.
