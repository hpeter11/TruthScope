==== Ministerial dismissal and suspension ====
On 8 February 2025, Gwynne was dismissed from the government as health minister and suspended from the Labour Party for offensive comments he had posted in a WhatsApp group used by Manchester Labour politicians.
In these messages, Gwynne mockingly suggested a reply to a constituent who had complained about a bin collection: "Dear resident, Fuck your bins. I’m re-elected and without your vote. Screw you. PS: Hopefully you’ll have croaked it by the all-outs". Gwynne wrote in the group that Diane Abbott's appearance as the first black woman at Prime Minister's Questions was a "joke" for Black History Month, and retweeted a tweet making sexualised comments about fellow Labour MP Angela Rayner.  Gwynne wrote that American psychologist Marshall Rosenberg's name "sounds too militaristic and too Jewish", and asked if Rosenberg was a member of Israel's intelligence service, Mossad.
In response, Gwynne wrote: "I deeply regret my badly misjudged comments and apologise for any offense I’ve caused" and "I entirely understand the decisions the PM and the party have taken and, while very sad to have been suspended, will support them in any way I can."
A second Labour MP Oliver Ryan was also involved in the scandal and is being investigated.
