== Format ==

The event is the 34th consecutive edition of the Welsh Open since it was first played in 1992, making it snooker's third longest running ranking tournament after the World Championship and UK Championship. The fourth and final event in the season's Home Nations Series (following the 2024 Scottish Open), and the 13th ranking tournament of the 2024‍–‍25 season (following the 2025 German Masters and preceding the 2025 World Open), it is taking place from 10 to 16 February 2025 at Venue Cymru in Llandudno, Wales.
Qualifying took place from 4 to 6 February 2025 in Barnsley, England. The WST implemented a new format for the four Home Nations events and the German Masters this season. In qualifying round one, players seeded 65‍–‍96 face those seeded 97‍–‍128. In qualifying round two, the 32 round one winners play those seeded 33‍–‍64. The 32 round two winners then play the top 32 seeds in the first round of the main stage.
All matches are played as the best of seven frames until the quarter‑finals, which are the best of nine. The semi‑finals are the best of 11, and the final is a best of 17 frames match played over two sessions. The defending champion was Gary Wilson, who defeated Martin O'Donnell 9‍–‍4 in the 2024 final in what was O'Donnell's first ranking final, but he lost 3‍–‍4 to Ishpreet Singh Chadha in the first round.
