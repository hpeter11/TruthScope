"Luther" is a song by the American rapper Kendrick Lamar and the American singer-songwriter SZA. Titled after the American R&B and soul singer Luther Vandross, the track contains a sample of Vandross and Cheryl Lynn's 1982 rendition of "If This World Were Mine", originally performed by Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell. "Luther" was released as the third single from Lamar's sixth studio album, GNX, on November 29, 2024, through PGLang and Interscope Records.
The song was written by both Lamar and SZA, along with Ink and Sam Dew, while production was handled by Sounwave, Jack Antonoff, Ruchaun "Scott Bridgeway" Akers, Kamasi Washington, Matthew "M-Tech" Bernard and Roshwita "Rose Lilah" Bacha.


== Composition ==
"Luther" is a "love ballad" accentuated by various string sections against 808 beats and hi-hats which was called a blend of contemporary R&B and hip-hop by Screen Rant. It features a sample of "If This World Were Mine", written by Marvin Gaye and performed by Luther Vandross and Cheryl Lynn, and builds on the song title from the very beginning. Lamar in a "monotone" delivery kicks off the "love story" by confessing his love for the protagonist, presumably a sex worker or a misunderstood “promiscuous woman”. SZA steps in during the choruses to reflect from the standpoint of the woman Lamar had introduced the listener to beforehand. The chorus consists of harmonizations between Lamar and SZA, while the latter's vocals are more highlighted and layered on top of Lamar's.


== Critical reception ==
Writing for NME, Kyann-Sian Williams thought the song was yet another demonstration of the duo's "chart-topping chemistry" and praised their "debonair" take on a "traditional love ballad". Lindsay Zoladz at The New York Times called "Luther" a notably "tender moment" and "three-minute pause" from an otherwise boastful album. Tomás Mier of Rolling Stone noted Lamar for "stretching his singing chops" before being joined by SZA.


== Commercial performance ==
In New Zealand, "Luther" debuted at number one on the Official Aotearoa Music Charts, marking Lamar's fourth overall number-one single in the country, and his second for 2024. Lamar made history on the December 21, 2024, issue of Billboard by replacing himself at number one on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart with "Luther", becoming the first artist to achieve three consecutive number ones without interruption in the magazine's history.
