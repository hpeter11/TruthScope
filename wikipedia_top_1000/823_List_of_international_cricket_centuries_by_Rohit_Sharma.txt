The score remains the highest individual total by a batsman in the format.

Sharma set the record for most centuries scored in a World Cup when he scored five centuries in the 2019 World Cup. He has scored centuries against nine different opponents and has the joint second-highest number of centuries (eight) against Australia in the format. As of January 2020, Sharma has eight scores in excess of 150, and three double-centuries, both of which are records in ODIs. He has the second highest number of centuries for an active player in the format.

He scored three centuries in the home series against South Africa in October 2019—including 176 and 127 in the first match, and a career-highest score of 212 in the third match.
Sharma made his T20I debut during the ICC T20 World Cup 2007 against England.
In October 2015, he became the second Indian to score a century in the T20I format when he made 106 against South Africa.
