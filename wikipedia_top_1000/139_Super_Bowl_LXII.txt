Super Bowl LXII is the planned American football championship game of the National Football League (NFL) for the 2027 season. The game is scheduled to be played in February 2028, at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, Georgia. 
This game would be the fourth Super Bowl hosted by the city of Atlanta. It will also be the second at this venue, the first being Super Bowl LIII in 2019. The game is planned to be televised nationally by CBS.


== Background ==


=== Host selection ===
The league has made all decisions regarding hosting sites from Super Bowl LVII (held in February 2023) onward. There is no bidding process per site: the league selects a potential venue unilaterally, the chosen team puts together a hosting proposal, and then the league votes to determine whether it is acceptable.
On October 15, 2024, the NFL announced that Mercedes-Benz Stadium, home of the Atlanta Falcons, was selected as the Super Bowl site.
