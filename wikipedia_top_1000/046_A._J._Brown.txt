Tennessee also received a third-round pick. Brown signed a four-year, $100 million contract with the Eagles after the trade, with $57 million guaranteed. The trade was opposed by Titans head coach Mike Vrabel. Brown's absence contributed to a decrease of 60 receptions and 860 yards among Titans wide receivers through 13 weeks, and was one reason for the Titans decision to fire general manager Jon Robinson at that point in the season.

On October 29, 2023, Brown recorded his sixth consecutive game with at least 125 receiving yards, which broke the standing NFL record of five straight games.
