Super Bowl LX is the planned American football championship game of the National Football League (NFL) for the 2025 season. The game is scheduled to be played on February 8, 2026, at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California. 
This will be the third Super Bowl to be held in the San Francisco Bay Area and the second Levi's Stadium will host, the first being Super Bowl 50 ten years prior. The game is planned to be televised nationally by NBC.


== Background ==


=== Host selection ===

The league has made all decisions regarding hosting sites from Super Bowl LVII (held in February 2023) onward. There is no bidding process per site: the league selects a potential venue unilaterally, the chosen team puts together a hosting proposal, and then the league owners vote to determine whether it is acceptable.
On May 18, 2023, it was reported that Levi's Stadium, home of the San Francisco 49ers, was considered the front-runner for the Super Bowl LX site. On May 22, the NFL announced that Super Bowl LX will be played at Levi's Stadium.


=== Logo ===
The official logo for Super Bowl LIX was unveiled on February 10, 2025, and follows the logo template established since Super Bowl LVI, with the Roman numerals featuring imagery representing the host city/region.
For Super Bowl LX, the design features numerous Bay Area landmarks, such as the San Francisco skyline, the Golden Gate Bridge, and numerous redwood trees, which are plentiful throughout the Bay Area. A multi-color logo design was purposefully chosen to deter conspiracy theories about certain colors representing teams that are viewed as the NFL's preferred choice to be in the game.

==== Television ====
Super Bowl LX is scheduled to be televised by NBC as part of the 11-year NFL television contract, which allows a four-year rotation between CBS, Fox, NBC, and ABC/ESPN. Under this rotation, the league awarded NBC the Super Bowl during the same years it has its Winter Olympics coverage. Super Bowl LX will be the second time after Super Bowl LVI that the game is scheduled on a date that falls within the date range of an ongoing Olympics event (and the third that the date will be on an Olympic year and for both events to be scheduled to air on the same network), the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy. As it has in previous years, NBC will offer bundled packages of commercial slots covering the Super Bowl, Olympics and (new for 2026) the NBA All-Star Game.
It is expected that a Spanish-language feed will air on one of NBC's sister networks, either Telemundo or Universo.


==== Streaming ====
The game is planned to be streamed live on Peacock, as well as NFL+ via mobile devices.


==== Radio ====
Westwood One holds the national radio rights to the game.


=== International ===
In the United Kingdom and Ireland, the game will be televised on a free-to-air channel to be confirmed and Sky Sports.
In Latin America, the game will be televised by ESPN and its streaming and on-demand platform Disney+.
