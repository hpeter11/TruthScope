With a Week 15 win over the Pittsburgh Steelers, the Eagles also improved on their 11–6 record from the previous season, and won ten consecutive games for the first time in franchise history. In Week 17, the Eagles clinched the NFC East and with that win, swept the Dallas Cowboys for the first time since 2011. With their Week 18 win over the New York Giants, the Eagles finished 14–3 for the second time in three seasons. The Eagles defeated the Green Bay Packers 22–10 in the Wild Card Round and the Los Angeles Rams 28–22 in the Divisional Round. In the NFC Championship Game, the Eagles defeated their division rival Washington Commanders 55–23 to advance to Super Bowl LIX.

NFL Brazil games

In the first quarter, the Eagles turned the ball over twice in Packers territory, however, the defense was able to hold them to field goals both times, thus the Eagles only trailed 6–0 after the first quarter. In the second quarter, both teams exchanged touchdowns twice to make the score 19–14 in favor of the Packers, before the Eagles drove down the field. Despite taking up the final five minutes from the half, the Eagles were held to a field goal, resulting in the score being 19–17 at halftime. After the two sides exchanged touchdowns in the third quarter, the Eagles were able to take a 31–26 lead after Jordan Love got picked off deep in Eagles territory. Following a miss by Brayden Narveson from 43 yards out, the Eagles drove all the way to the Packers 14 yard line before Jalen Hurts got intercepted in the end zone. However, the Packers were held to a field goal on their next drive, and on their next possession, the Eagles drained the clock to just 27 seconds before kicking a field goal to take a 34–29 lead. Despite the Packers reaching midfield, Zack Baun got a sack on Malik Willis after Love exited the game due to an injury, clinching the win.


==== Week 2: vs. Atlanta Falcons ====

Despite having the ball deep in Atlanta territory up 18–15, giving the team a 99% chance of victory, the Eagles could not hold on and were dealt their first home loss to the Falcons since the 2012 season. A dropped pass by Saquon Barkley stopped the clock, giving Atlanta time on the final drive to take the lead with 34 seconds remaining in regulation. Jessie Bates III then picked off Jalen Hurts on the Eagles' final drive, securing the 22–21 upset victory for Atlanta and dropping Philadelphia to 1–1 on the year.


==== Week 3: at New Orleans Saints ====

The Eagles fell behind 3–0 after three quarters following two turnovers from quarterback Jalen Hurts and two failed fourth-down conversions in New Orleans territory. However, at the beginning of the final quarter, Saquon Barkley rushed for a 65-yard touchdown after the Saints had a turnover on downs deep in Eagles territory following a blocked punt. Following a field goal by the Saints, Eagles kicker Jake Elliott missed a 60-yard field goal, and the Saints scored a touchdown to take a 12–7 lead with just over two minutes left. However, a short pass from Hurts to Dallas Goedert for 61 yards on 3rd-and-16 set up another touchdown plus a two-point conversion by Barkley to make it a 15–12 Eagles lead. Reed Blankenship picked off Derek Carr on the final drive to seal the win. The Eagles won in New Orleans for the first time since 2007.


==== Week 4: at Tampa Bay Buccaneers ====
