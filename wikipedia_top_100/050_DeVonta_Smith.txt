=== 2021 season ===

Smith was selected by the Philadelphia Eagles with the tenth overall pick in the 2021 NFL draft, who had traded up two spots with the Dallas Cowboys to select him. He was the third wide receiver taken in the draft after Ja'Marr Chase and Jaylen Waddle. Despite his impressive college statistics Smith fell in the draft due to concerns over his raw measurables and that his frame was considered too small to handle playing in the NFL. He signed a four-year rookie contract, worth $20.1 million, on June 3, 2021.
In week 1, against the Atlanta Falcons, Smith scored his first career touchdown on his first catch in the NFL. He had seven receptions for 122 yards in a Week 4 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs.
